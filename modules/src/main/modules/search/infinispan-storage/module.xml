<!--
This Module is meant to be used exclusively by Hibernate Search as used in combination with Hibernate ORM;
(Not the Hibernate Search version used by Infinispan Query as an internal dependency).

It is a slimmed down alternative for the combination of modules normally built by the Infinispan project:
 - org.infinispan.lucene-directory
 - org.infinispan

As it needs to link to the classloaders of Hibernate Search without introducing possible linkage errors,
it needs to point to the slot of module org.apache.lucene of the consuming Hibernate Search,
and obviously needs to avoid dependencies to different versions of Hibernate Search.
