/**
 * Given a property, defines how a dependency of the indexing process to this property
 * should affect automatic indexing.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is generally not needed, as the default behavior is to consider all properties
 * that are actually used in the indexing process as dependencies that trigger reindexing when they are updated.
 * <p>
 * However, some tuning may be required for some properties:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Some properties may be updated very frequently
 *     and/or trigger reindexing to other entities that are very expensive to load in memory.
 *     In that case, it may be a good idea to tell Hibernate Search to ignore updates to those properties
 *     using {@link #reindexOnUpdate()}.
 *     The index will be slightly out-of-sync whenever the property is modified,
 *     but this can be solved by triggering reindexing manually, for example every night.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Some properties may be computed dynamically based on other properties, instead of being stored.
 *     In that case, the mapper may not be able to detect changes to the computed property directly.
 *     Thus Hibernate Search needs to know which other properties are used when generating the value of this property,
 *     which can be configured using {@link #derivedFrom()}.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This annotation may be applied multiple times to the same property with different {@link #extraction() extractions},
 * to configure differently the dependency to different container elements.
 * For example with a property of type {@code Map<Entity1, Entity2>},
 * one can have a dependency to {@code Entity1} (map keys) or {@code Entity2} (map values),
 * and each may require a different configuration.
