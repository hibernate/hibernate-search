# The main CI of Hibernate Search is https://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-search/.
# However, Hibernate Search builds run on GitHub actions regularly
# to build on Windows
# and check that both the Linux and Windows workflows still work
# and can be used in GitHub forks.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/actions
# for more information about GitHub actions.
