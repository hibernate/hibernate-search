    groups:
      # This group combines all build-only dependencies. Published artifacts do not depend on them.
      # Grouping such dependencies will make Dependabot create PRs with a branch name
      # following the pattern (`dependabot/maven/build-dependencies-.*`)
      # and with a title like `Bump the build-dependencies group with 8 updates` that we can easily
      # use for Hibernate Bot rules.
