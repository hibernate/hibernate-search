# The main CI of Hibernate Search is https://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-search/.
# However, Hibernate Search builds run on Travis CI regularly
# to check that it still works and can be used in GitHub forks.
# See https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci to activate
# Travis in your own fork of Hibernate Search.
