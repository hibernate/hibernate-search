# The main CI of Hibernate Search is http://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-search/. Travis CI can be
# used in github forks. https://travis-ci.org/hibernate/hibernate-search is
# therefore deactivated. Activating Travis for your own fork is as easy as
# activating it in the travis site of your fork.
