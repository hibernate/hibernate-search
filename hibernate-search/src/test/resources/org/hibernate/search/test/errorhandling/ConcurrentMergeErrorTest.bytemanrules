# ConcurrentMergeErrorTest
#
# Using Byteman we alter IndexWriter at runtime to throw an IOException during the merge operation, this might happen
# in a secondary thread.
# The flag "createIndexWriterIOException" is checked to make sure we only raise the exception when requested,
# i.e. when we are running the ConcurrentMergeErrorHandledTest
