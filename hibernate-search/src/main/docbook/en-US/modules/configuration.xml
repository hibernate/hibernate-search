    <title>Enabling Hibernate Search and automatic indexing</title>

    <para>Let's start with the most basic configuration question - how to
    enable Hibernate Search in your system.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Enabling Hibernate Search</title>

      <para>The good news is that Hibernate Search is enabled out of the box
      when detected on the classpath by Hibernate Core. If, for some reason
      you need to disable it, set
      <literal>hibernate.search.autoregister_listeners</literal> to false.
      Note that there is no performance penalty when the listeners are enabled
      but no entities are annotated as indexed.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Automatic indexing</title>

      <para>By default, every time an object is inserted, updated or deleted
      through Hibernate, Hibernate Search updates the according Lucene index.
      It is sometimes desirable to disable that features if either your index
      is read-only or if index updates are done in a batch way (see <xref
      linkend="search-batchindex" />).</para>

      <para>To disable event based indexing, set</para>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.indexing_strategy = manual</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>In most case, the JMS backend provides the best of both world, a
        lightweight event based system keeps track of all changes in the
        system, and the heavyweight indexing process is done by a separate
        process or machine.</para>

  <section id="search-configuration-directory" revision="1">
    <title>Directory configuration</title>

    <para>Apache Lucene has a notion of a <classname>Directory</classname> to
    store the index files. The <classname>Directory</classname> implementation
    can be customized and Lucene comes bundled with a file system and an
    in-memory implementation. <classname>DirectoryProvider</classname> is the
    Hibernate Search abstraction around a Lucene
    <classname>Directory</classname> and handles the configuration and the
    initialization of the underlying Lucene resources. <xref
    linkend="directory-provider-table" /> shows the list of the directory
    providers available in Hibernate Search together with their corresponding
    options.</para>

    <para>To configure your <classname>DirectoryProvider</classname> you have
    to understand that each indexed entity is associated to a Lucene index
    (except of the case where multiple entities share the same index - <xref
    linkend="section-sharing-indexes" />). The name of the index is given by
    the <constant>index</constant> property of the
    <classname>@Indexed</classname> annotation. If the
    <constant>index</constant> property is not specified the fully qualified
    name of the indexed class will be used as name.</para>

    <para>Knowing the index name, you can configure the directory provider and
    any additional options by using the prefix
    <constant>hibernate.search.</constant><replaceable>&lt;indexname&gt;</replaceable>.
    The name <constant>default</constant>
    (<constant>hibernate.search.default</constant>) is reserved and can be
    used to define properties which apply to all indexes. <xref
    linkend="example-configuring-directory-providers" /> shows how
    <constant>hibernate.search.default.directory_provider</constant> is used
    to set the default directory provider to be the filesystem one.
    <constant>hibernate.search.default.indexBase</constant> sets then the
    default base directory for the indexes. As a result the index for the
    entity <classname>Status</classname> is created in
    <filename>/usr/lucene/indexes/org.hibernate.example.Status</filename>.</para>

    <para>The index for the <classname>Rule</classname> entity, however, is
    using an in-memory directory, because the default directory provider for
    this entity is overriden by the property
    <constant>hibernate.search.Rules.directory_provider</constant>.</para>

    <para>Finally the <classname>Action</classname> entity uses a custom
    directory provider <classname>CustomDirectoryProvider</classname>
    specified via
    <constant>hibernate.search.Actions.directory_provider</constant>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Specifying the index name</title>

      <programlisting>package org.hibernate.example;

@Indexed
public class Status { ... }

@Indexed(index="Rules")
public class Rule { ... }

@Indexed(index="Actions")
public class Action { ... }</programlisting>
    </example>

    <example id="example-configuring-directory-providers">
      <title>Configuring directory providers</title>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.default.directory_provider filesystem
hibernate.search.default.indexBase=/usr/lucene/indexes
hibernate.search.Rules.directory_provider ram
hibernate.search.Actions.directory_provider com.acme.hibernate.CustomDirectoryProvider</programlisting>
    </example>

    <tip>
      <para>Using the described configuration scheme you can easily define
      common rules like the directory provider and base directory, and
      override those defaults later on on a per index basis.</para>

    <title>Sharding indexes</title>

    <para>In some cases it can be useful to split (shard) the indexed data of
    a given entity into several Lucene indexes.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>This solution is not recommended unless there is a pressing need.
      Searches will be slower as all shards have to be opened for a single
      search. Don't do it until you have a real use case!</para>
    </warning>

    <para>Possible use cases for sharding are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A single index is so huge that index update times are slowing
        the application down.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A typical search will only hit a sub-set of the index, such as
        when data is naturally segmented by customer, region or
        application.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By default sharding is not enabled unless the number of shards is
    configured. To do this use the
    <constant>hibernate.search.&lt;indexName&gt;.sharding_strategy.nbr_of_shards</constant>
    property as seen in <xref linkend="example-index-sharding" />. In this
    example 5 shards are enabled.</para>

      <title>Enabling index sharding</title>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.&lt;indexName&gt;.sharding_strategy.nbr_of_shards 5</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Responsible for splitting the data into sub-indexes is the
    <classname>IndexShardingStrategy</classname>. The default sharding
    strategy splits the data according to the hash value of the id string
    representation (generated by the <classname>FieldBridge</classname>). This
    ensures a fairly balanced sharding. You can replace the default strategy
    by implementing a custom <classname>IndexShardingStrategy</classname>. To
    use your custom strategy you have to set the
    <constant>hibernate.search.&lt;indexName&gt;.sharding_strategy</constant>
    property.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Specifying a custom sharding strategy</title>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.&lt;indexName&gt;.sharding_strategy my.shardingstrategy.Implementation</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The <classname> IndexShardingStrategy</classname> also allows for
    optimizing searches by selecting which shard to run the query against. By
    activating a filter (see <xref linkend="query-filter-shard" />), a
    sharding strategy can select a subset of the shards used to answer a query
    (<classname>IndexShardingStrategy.getDirectoryProvidersForQuery</classname>)
    and thus speed up the query execution.</para>

    <para>Each shard has an independent directory provider configuration. The
    <classname>DirectoryProvider</classname> index names for the Animal entity
    in <xref linkend="example-sharding-configuration" /> are
    <literal>Animal.0</literal> to <literal>Animal.4</literal>. In other
    words, each shard has the name of it's owning index followed by
    <constant>.</constant> (dot) and its index number (see also <xref
    linkend="search-configuration-directory" />).</para>

    <title>Sharing indexes</title>

    <para>It is technically possible to store the information of more than one
    entity into a single Lucene index. There are two ways to accomplish
    this:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Configuring the underlying directory providers to point to the
        same physical index directory. In practice, you set the property
        <literal>hibernate.search.[fully qualified entity
        name].indexName</literal> to the same value. As an example let’s use
        the same index (directory) for the <classname>Furniture</classname>
        and <classname>Animal</classname> entity. We just set
        <literal>indexName</literal> for both entities to for example
        “Animal”. Both entities will then be stored in the Animal
        directory.</para>

        <para><programlisting>hibernate.search.org.hibernate.search.test.shards.Furniture.indexName = Animal
hibernate.search.org.hibernate.search.test.shards.Animal.indexName = Animal</programlisting></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Setting the <code>@Indexed</code> annotation’s
        <methodname>index</methodname> attribute of the entities you want to
        merge to the same value. If we again wanted all
        <classname>Furniture</classname> instances to be indexed in the
        <classname>Animal</classname> index along with all instances of
        <classname>Animal</classname> we would specify
        <code>@Indexed(index="Animal")</code> on both
        <classname>Animal</classname> and <classname>Furniture</classname>
        classes.<note>
            <para>This is only presented here so that you know the option is
            available. There is really not much benefit in sharing
            indexes.</para>

    <title>Worker configuration</title>

    <para>It is possible to refine how Hibernate Search interacts with Lucene
    through the worker configuration. There exist several architectural
    components and possible extension points. Let's have a closer look.</para>

    <para>First there is a <classname>Worker</classname>. An implementation of
    the <classname>Worker</classname> interface is reponsible for receiving
    all entity changes, queuing them by context and applying them once a
    context ends. The most intuative context, especially in connection with
    ORM, is the transaction. For this reason Hibernate Search will per default
    use the <classname>TransactionalWorker</classname> to scope all changes
    per transaction. One can, however, imagine a scenario where the context
    depends for example on the number of entity changes or some other
    application (lifecycle) events. For this reason the
    <classname>Worker</classname> implementation is configurable as shown in
    <xref linkend="table-worker-configuration" />.</para>

    <table id="table-worker-configuration">
      <title>Scope configuration</title>

      <tgroup cols="2">
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry><emphasis role="bold">Property</emphasis></entry>

            <entry>The fully qualifed class name of the
            <classname>Worker</classname> implementation to use. If this
            property is not set, empty or <literal>transaction</literal> the

            <entry>All configuration properties prefixed with
            <literal>hibernate.search.worker</literal> are passed to the
            Worker during initialization. This allows adding custom, worker
            specific parameters.</entry>

          <row>
            <entry><literal>hibernate.search.worker.batch_size</literal></entry>

            <entry>Defines the maximum number of indexing operation batched
            per context. Once the limit is reached indexing will be triggered
            even though the context has not ended yet. This property only
            works if the <classname>Worker</classname> implementation
            delegates the queued work to BatchedQueueingProcessor (which is
            what the <classname>TransactionalWorker</classname> does)</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>

    <para>Once a context ends it is time to prepare and apply the index
    changes. This can be done synchronously or asynchronously from within a
    new thread. Synchronous updates have the advantage that the index is at
    all times in sync with the databases. Asynchronous updates, on the other
    hand, can help to minimize the user response time. The drawback is
    potential discrepancies between database and index states. Lets look at
    the configuration options shown in <xref

    <para>This section describes in greater detail how to configure Hibernate
    Search to use an Infinispan Lucene Directory.</para>

    <para>When using an Infinispan Directory the index is stored in memory and
    shared across multiple nodes. It is considered a single directory across
    all participating nodes. If a node updates the index, all other nodes are
    updated as well. Updates on one node can be immediately searched for in
    the whole cluster.</para>

    <para>The default configuration replicates all data defining the index
    across all nodes, thus consuming a significant amount of memory. For large
    indexes it's suggested to enable data distribution, so that each piece of
    information is replicated to a subset of all cluster members.</para>

    <para>It is also possible to offload part or most information to a
    <literal>CacheStore</literal>, such as plain filesystem, Amazon S3,
    Cassandra, Berkley DB or standard relational databases. You can configure
    it to have a <literal>CacheStore</literal> on each node or have a single
    centralized one shared by each node.</para>

    <para>See the <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/infinispan/"> Infinispan
    documentation</ulink> for all Infinispan configuration options.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Requirements</title>

      <para>Infinispan requires Java 6 and an updated version of JGroups. To
      use the Infinispan directory via Maven, add the following
      dependencies:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Maven dependencies for Hibernate Search</title>

        <programlisting language="XML" role="XML">&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.hibernate&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;hibernate-search&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;&version;&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;org.hibernate&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;hibernate-search-infinispan&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;&version;&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>For the non-maven users, add
      <literal>hibernate-search-infinispan.jar</literal>,
      <literal>infinispan-lucene-directory.jar</literal> and
      <literal>infinispan-core.jar</literal> to your application classpath.
      These last two jars are distributed by <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/infinispan/files/">Infinispan</ulink>.
      Also make sure to update JGroups to a version matching the Infinispan
      requirements. The version normally distributed with Hibernate Search is
      older to maintain Java 5 compatibility.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Architecture</title>

      <para>Even when using an Infinispan directory it's still recommended to
      use the JMS Master/Slave or JGroups backend, because in Infinispan all
      nodes will share the same index and it is likely that
      <classname>IndexWriter</classname>s being active on different nodes will
      try to acquire the lock on the same index. So instead of sending updates
      directly to the index, send it to a JMS queue or JGroups channel and
      have a single node apply all changes on behalf of all other
      nodes.</para>

      <para>Configuring a non-default backend is not a requirement but a
      performance optimization as locks are enabled to have a single node
      writing.</para>

      <para>To configure a JMS slave only the backend must be replaced, the
      directory provider must be set to <literal>infinispan</literal>; set the
      same directory provider on the master, they will connect without the
      need to setup the copy job across nodes. Using the JGroups backend is
      very similar - just combine the backend configuration with the
      <literal>infinispan</literal> directory provider.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Infinispan Configuration</title>

      <para>The most simple configuration only requires to enable the
      backend:</para>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.default.directory_provider infinispan</programlisting>

      <para>That's all what is needed to get a cluster-replicated index, but
      the default configuration does not enable any form of permanent
      persistence for the index; to enable such a feature an Infinispan
      configuration file should be provided.</para>

      <para>To use Infinispan, Hibernate Search requirest a
      <classname>CacheManager</classname>; it can lookup and reuse an existing
      <classname>CacheManager,</classname> via JNDI, or start and manage a new
      one. In the latter case Hibernate Search will start and stop it (
      closing occurs when the Hibernate <classname>SessionFactory</classname>
      is closed).</para>

      <para>To use and existing <classname>CacheManager</classname> via JNDI
      (optional parameter):</para>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.infinispan.cachemanager_jndiname = [jndiname]</programlisting>

      <para>To start a new <classname>CacheManager</classname> from a
      configuration file (optional parameter):</para>

      <programlisting>hibernate.search.infinispan.configuration_resourcename = [infinispan configuration filename]</programlisting>

      <para>If both parameters are defined, JNDI will have priority. If none
      of these is defined, Hibernate Search will use the default Infinispan
      configuration included in
      <literal>hibernate-search-infinispan.jar</literal>. This configuration
      should work fine in most cases but does not store the index in a
      persistent cache store.</para>

      <para>As mentioned in <xref linkend="directory-provider-table" />, each
      index makes use of three caches, so three different caches should be
      configured as shown in the
      <literal>default-hibernatesearch-infinispan.xml</literal> provided in
      the <literal>hibernate-search-infinispan.jar</literal>. Several indexes
      can share the same caches.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Infinispan uses JGroups, which requires the JVM property
        <literal>java.net.preferIPv4Stack</literal> be set to
        <literal>true</literal>:
        <code>-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</code></para>

    <para>The different reader strategies are described in <xref

  <section id="lucene-indexing-performance" revision="3">
    <title>Tuning Lucene indexing performance</title>

    <para>Hibernate Search allows you to tune the Lucene indexing performance
    by specifying a set of parameters which are passed through to underlying
    Lucene <literal>IndexWriter</literal> such as
    <literal>mergeFactor</literal>, <literal>maxMergeDocs</literal> and
    <literal>maxBufferedDocs</literal>. You can specify these parameters
    either as default values applying for all indexes, on a per index basis,
    or even per shard.</para>

    <para>There are two sets of parameters allowing for different performance
    settings depending on the use case. During indexing operations triggered
    by database modifications, the parameters are grouped by the
    <literal>transaction</literal> keyword: <programlisting>hibernate.search.[default|&lt;indexname&gt;].indexwriter.transaction.&lt;parameter_name&gt;</programlisting>
    When indexing occurs via <literal>FullTextSession.index()</literal> or via
    a <classname>MassIndexer</classname> (see <xref
    linkend="search-batchindex" />), the used properties are those grouped
    under the <literal>batch</literal> keyword: <programlisting>hibernate.search.[default|&lt;indexname&gt;].indexwriter.batch.&lt;parameter_name&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>If no value is set for a <literal>batch</literal> value in a
    specific shard configuration, Hibernate Search will look at the index
    section, then at the default section.<example

    <title>Exception Handling Configuration</title>

    <para>Hibernate Search allows you to configure how exceptions are handled
    during the indexing process. If no configuration is provided then
    exceptions are logged to the log output by default. It is possible to
    explicitly declare the exception logging mechanism as seen below:</para>

    <para><programlisting>hibernate.search.error_handler log</programlisting>The
    default exception handling occurs for both synchronous and asynchronous
    indexing. Hibernate Search provides an easy mechanism to override the
    default error handling implementation.</para>

    <para>In order to provide your own implementation you must implement the
    <classname>ErrorHandler</classname> interface, which provides the
    <code>handle(ErrorContext context)</code> method.
    <code>ErrorContext</code> provides a reference to the primary
    <code>LuceneWork</code> instance, the underlying exception and any
    subsequent <code>LuceneWork</code> instances that could not be processed
    due to the primary exception.</para>

    <para><programlisting>public interface ErrorContext  {
   List&lt;LuceneWork&gt; getFailingOperations();
   LuceneWork getOperationAtFault();
   Throwable getThrowable();
   boolean hasErrors();
}</programlisting></para>

    <para>To register this error handler with Hibernate Search you must
    declare the fully qualified classname of your
    <classname>ErrorHandler</classname> implementation in the configuration
    properties:</para>
