  <title>Manual index changes</title>

  <para>As Hibernate core applies changes to the Database, Hibernate Search
  detects these changes and will update the index automatically (unless the
  EventListeners are disabled). Sometimes changes are made to the database
  without using Hibernate, as when backup is restored or your data is
  otherwise affected; for these cases Hibernate Search exposes the Manual
  Index APIs to explicitly update or remove a single entity from the index, or
  rebuild the index for the whole database, or remove all references to a
  specific type.</para>

  <para>All these methods affect the Lucene Index only, no changes are applied
  to the Database.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Adding instances to the index</title>

    <para>Using <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>index(T
    entity)</methodname> you can directly add or update a specific object
    instance to the index. If this entity was already indexed, then the index
    will be updated. Changes to the index are only applied at transaction
    commit.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Indexing an entity via <methodname>FullTextSession.index(T
      entity)</methodname></title>

      <programlisting>FullTextSession fullTextSession = Search.getFullTextSession(session);
Transaction tx = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
Object customer = fullTextSession.load( Customer.class, 8 );
<emphasis role="bold">fullTextSession.index(customer);</emphasis>
tx.commit(); //index only updated at commit time</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>In case you want to add all instances for a type, or for all indexed
    types, the recommended approach is to use a
    <classname>MassIndexer</classname>: see <xref
    linkend="search-batchindex-massindexer" /> for more details.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Deleting instances from the index</title>

    <para>It is equally possible to remove an entity or all entities of a
    given type from a Lucene index without the need to physically remove them
    from the database. This operation is named purging and is also done
    through the <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Purging a specific instance of an entity from the index</title>

      <programlisting>FullTextSession fullTextSession = Search.getFullTextSession(session);
Transaction tx = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
for (Customer customer : customers) {
    <emphasis role="bold">fullTextSession.purge( Customer.class, customer.getId() );</emphasis>
}
tx.commit(); //index is updated at commit time</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Purging will remove the entity with the given id from the Lucene
    index but will not touch the database.</para>

    <para>If you need to remove all entities of a given type, you can use the
    <methodname>purgeAll</methodname> method. This operation removes all
    entities of the type passed as a parameter as well as all its
    subtypes.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Purging all instances of an entity from the index</title>

      <programlisting>FullTextSession fullTextSession = Search.getFullTextSession(session);
Transaction tx = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
<emphasis role="bold">fullTextSession.purgeAll( Customer.class );</emphasis>
//optionally optimize the index
//fullTextSession.getSearchFactory().optimize( Customer.class );
tx.commit(); //index changes are applied at commit time    </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>It is recommended to optimize the index after such an
    operation.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Methods <methodname>index</methodname>,
      <methodname>purge</methodname> and <methodname>purgeAll</methodname> are
      available on <classname>FullTextEntityManager</classname> as
      well.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <para>All manual indexing methods (<methodname>index</methodname>,
      <methodname>purge</methodname> and <methodname>purgeAll</methodname>)
      only affect the index, not the database, nevertheless they are
      transactional and as such they won't be applied until the transaction is
      successfully committed, or you make use of
      <methodname>flushToIndexes</methodname>.</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section id="search-batchindex">
    <title>Rebuilding the whole index</title>

    <para>If you change the entity mapping to the index, chances are that the
    whole Index needs to be updated; For example if you decide to index a an
    existing field using a different analyzer you'll need to rebuild the index
    for affected types. Also if the Database is replaced (like restored from a
    backup, imported from a legacy system) you'll want to be able to rebuild
    the index from existing data. Hibernate Search provides two main
    strategies to choose from:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Using
        <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>flushToIndexes()</methodname>
        periodically, while using
        <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>index()</methodname>
        on all entities.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Use a <classname>MassIndexer</classname>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="search-batchindex-flushtoindexes">
      <title>Using flushToIndexes()</title>

      <para>This strategy consists in removing the existing index and then
      adding all entities back to the index using
      <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>purgeAll()</methodname>
      and
      <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>index()</methodname>,
      however there are some memory and efficiency contraints. For maximum
      efficiency Hibernate Search batches index operations and executes them
      at commit time. If you expect to index a lot of data you need to be
      careful about memory consumption since all documents are kept in a queue
      until the transaction commit. You can potentially face an
      <classname>OutOfMemoryException</classname> if you don't empty the queue
      periodically: to do this you can use
      <methodname>fullTextSession.flushToIndexes()</methodname>. Every time
      <methodname>fullTextSession.flushToIndexes()</methodname> is called (or
      if the transaction is committed), the batch queue is processed applying
      all index changes. Be aware that, once flushed, the changes cannot be
      rolled back.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Index rebuilding using index() and flushToIndexes()</title>

        <programlisting>fullTextSession.setFlushMode(FlushMode.MANUAL);
fullTextSession.setCacheMode(CacheMode.IGNORE);
transaction = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
//Scrollable results will avoid loading too many objects in memory
ScrollableResults results = fullTextSession.createCriteria( Email.class )
    .setFetchSize(BATCH_SIZE)
    .scroll( ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY );
int index = 0;
while( results.next() ) {
    index++;
    fullTextSession.index( results.get(0) ); //index each element
    if (index % BATCH_SIZE == 0) {
        fullTextSession.flushToIndexes(); //apply changes to indexes
        fullTextSession.clear(); //free memory since the queue is processed
    }
}
transaction.commit();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <note>
        <para><literal>hibernate.search.worker.batch_size</literal> has been
        deprecated in favor of this explicit API which provides better
        control</para>
      </note>

      <para>Try to use a batch size that guarantees that your application will
      not run out of memory: with a bigger batch size objects are fetched
      faster from database but more memory is needed.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="search-batchindex-massindexer">
      <title>Using a MassIndexer</title>

      <para>Hibernate Search's <classname>MassIndexer</classname> uses several
      parallel threads to rebuild the index; you can optionally select which
      entities need to be reloaded or have it reindex all entities. This
      approach is optimized for best performance but requires to set the
      application in maintenance mode: making queries to the index is not
      recommended when a MassIndexer is busy.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Index rebuilding using a MassIndexer</title>

        <programlisting>fullTextSession.createIndexer().startAndWait();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>This will rebuild the index, deleting it and then reloading all
      entities from the database. Although it's simple to use, some tweaking
      is recommended to speed up the process: there are several parameters
      configurable.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>During the progress of a MassIndexer the content of the index is
        undefined, make sure that nobody will try to make some query during
        index rebuilding! If somebody should query the index it will not
        corrupt but most results will likely be missing.</para>
      </warning>

      <example>
        <title>Using a tuned MassIndexer</title>

        <programlisting>fullTextSession
 .createIndexer( User.class )
 .batchSizeToLoadObjects( 25 )
 .cacheMode( CacheMode.NORMAL )
 .threadsToLoadObjects( 5 )
 .threadsForIndexWriter( 3 )
 .threadsForSubsequentFetching( 20 )
 .progressMonitor( monitor ) //a MassIndexerProgressMonitor implementation
 .startAndWait();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>This will rebuild the index of all User instances (and subtypes),
      and will create 5 parallel threads to load the User instances using
      batches of 25 objects per query; these loaded User instances are then
      pipelined to 20 parallel threads to load the attached lazy collections
      of User containing some information needed for the index. Finally,
      3 parallel threads are being used to Analyze the text and write to the
      index.</para>

      <para>It is recommended to leave cacheMode to
      <literal>CacheMode.IGNORE</literal> (the default), as in most reindexing
      situations the cache will be a useless additional overhead; it might be
      useful to enable some other <literal>CacheMode</literal> depending on
      your data: it might increase performance if the main entity is relating
      to enum-like data included in the index.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>The "sweet spot" of number of threads to achieve best
        performance is highly dependent on your overall architecture, database
        design and even data values. To find out the best number of threads
        for your application it is recommended to use a profiler: all internal
        thread groups have meaningful names to be easily identified with most
        tools.</para>
      </tip>

      <note>
        <para>The MassIndexer was designed for speed and is unaware of
        transactions, so there is no need to begin one or committing. Also
        because it is not transactional it is not recommended to let users use
        the system during it's processing, as it is unlikely people will be
        able to find results and the system load might be too high
        anyway.</para>
      </note>
    </section>

    <para>Other parameters which affect indexing time and memory
    consumption are:</para>

      <listitem>
        <literal>hibernate.search.batchbackend.concurrent_writers</literal>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>Previous versions also had a <literal>max_field_length</literal> but this was removed from Lucene,
    it's possible to obtain a similar effect by using a <classname>LimitTokenCountAnalyzer</classname>.</para>

    <para>All <literal>.indexwriter</literal> parameters are Lucene specific
    and Hibernate Search is just passing these parameters through - see <xref
    linkend="lucene-indexing-performance" /> for more details.</para>
    
    <para><literal>hibernate.search.batchbackend.concurrent_writers</literal> defaults to
        <literal>2</literal> and represent the number of threads being used at the Analysis
        and indexwriter stage of the MassIndexing pipeline. The <classname>MassIndexer</classname>
        .<methodname>threadsForIndexWriter(int)</methodname> method overrides this value.</para>
