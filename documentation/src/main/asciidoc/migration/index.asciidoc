== Introduction

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating
an existing application using any version `{hibernateSearchPreviousStableVersionShort}.x` of Hibernate Search
to the latest of the `{hibernateSearchVersionShort}.x` series.

NOTE: If you think something is missing or something does not work, please link:https://hibernate.org/community[contact us].

If you're looking to migrate from an earlier version,
you should migrate step-by-step, from one minor version to the next,
following the migration guide of link:https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/[each version].

[[recommended-procedure]]
== Recommended procedure

Search 6 introduces new APIs, so migrating older projects will be more work than usual.

To facilitate the process of migrating, Hibernate Search 6 includes a "migration helper" module
that allows you to use the Hibernate Search 5 APIs with Hibernate Search 6 and a Lucene backend under the hood.
However, this module does not offer full backward compatibility: for some features that changed dramatically,
it may not be possible to use the Search 5 APIs anymore.
See <<migration-helper>> for more information.

[NOTE]
====
For those who cannot afford to, or do not want to, spend the time required to migrate,
we intend to continue maintenance releases (= bugfixes) of Hibernate Search 5.x:
no end-of-life date has been set at the moment.
