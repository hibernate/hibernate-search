[[introduction]]
== [[_introduction]] Introduction

The aim of this guide is to assist you migrating
an existing application using any version `{hibernateSearchPreviousStableVersionShort}.x` of Hibernate Search
to the latest of the `{hibernateSearchVersionShort}.x` series.

NOTE: If you think something is missing or something does not work, please link:https://hibernate.org/community[contact us].

If you're looking to migrate from an earlier version,
you should migrate step-by-step, from one minor version to the next,
following the migration guide of link:https://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/[each version].

[WARNING]
====
**To Hibernate Search 5 users**

Be aware that a lot of APIs have changed since Hibernate Search 5, some only because of a package change,
others because of more fundamental changes
(like moving away from using Lucene types in Hibernate Search APIs).

When migrating from Hibernate Search 5, you are encouraged to migrate first to Hibernate Search 6.0
using the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/migration/html_single/[6.0 migration guide],
and only then to later versions (which will be significantly easier).

as it's a part of the configurer API.
