A decent introduction is included in the getting started guide: see <<getting-started-analysis>>.

TODO The getting started section has a link pointing here and expects the section to

We also need to explain the difference between analyzer and normalizer.

For more information about how to configure analysis,
see the documentation of each backend:

* <<backend-lucene-analysis,Analysis for the Lucene backend>>
