== Further reading

Last but not least, a few pointers to further information. We highly recommend you to get a copy of
link:$$http://www.manning.com/bernard/$$[Hibernate Search in Action]. This excellent book covers
Hibernate Search in much more depth than this online documentation can and has a great range of
additional examples. If you want to increase your knowledge of Lucene we recommend
link:$$http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/$$[Lucene in Action (Second Edition)].

Because Hibernate Search's functionality is tightly coupled to Hibernate ORM it is a good idea to understand
Hibernate. Start with the link:$$http://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/$$[online documentation] or get hold
of a copy of link:$$http://www.manning.com/bauer3/$$[Java Persistence with Hibernate, Second Edition].

If you have any further questions regarding Hibernate Search or want to share some of your use cases
have a look at the link:$$https://community.jboss.org/en/hibernate/search$$[Hibernate Search Wiki]
and the link:$$https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=9$$[Hibernate Search Forum]. We are
looking forward hearing from you.

In case you would like to report a bug use the
link:$$https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH$$[Hibernate Search JIRA] instance. Feedback is
always welcome!
