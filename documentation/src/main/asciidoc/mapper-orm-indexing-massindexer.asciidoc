== Basics

There are cases where automatic indexing is not enough,
because a pre-existing database has to be indexed:

* when restoring a database backup;
* when indexes had to be wiped,
for example because the Hibernate Search mapping or some core settings changed;
* when automatic indexing had to be disabled for performance reasons,
and periodic reindexing (every night, ...) is preferred.

To address these situations, Hibernate Search provides the `MassIndexer`:
a tool to rebuild indexes completely based on the content of the database.
It can be told to reindex a few selected indexed types, or all of them.
