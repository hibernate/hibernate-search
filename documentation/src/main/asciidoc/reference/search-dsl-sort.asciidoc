[[search-dsl-sort-concepts]]
== Basics

By default, query results are sorted by <<search-dsl-sort-score,matching score (relevance)>>.
Other sorts, including the sort by field value, can be configured when building the search query:

.Using custom sorts
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=entryPoint-lambdas]
----
<1> Start building the query as usual.
<2> Mention that the results of the query are expected to be sorted on field "pageCount" in descending order,
then (for those with the same page count) on field "title_sort" in ascending order.
If the field does not exist or cannot be sorted on, an exception will be thrown.
<3> Fetch the results, which will be sorted according to instructions.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use lambdas:

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=entryPoint-objects]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
There are a few constraints regarding sorts by field.
In particular, in order for a field to be "sortable", it must be <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-sortable,marked as such in the mapping>>,
so that the correct data structures are available in the index.
====

The sort DSL offers more sort types, and multiple options for each type of sort.
To learn more about the `field` sort, and all the other types of sort,
refer to the following sections.

[[search-dsl-sort-score]]
== `score`: sort by matching score (relevance)

`score` sorts on the score of each document:

* in descending order (the default), documents with a higher score appear first in the list of hits.
* in ascending order, documents with a lower score appear first in the list of hits.

The score is computed differently for each query,
but roughly speaking you can consider that a higher score means that more <<search-dsl-predicate,predicates>>
were matched, or they were matched better.
Thus, the score of a given document is a representation of how relevant that document is to a particular query.

[TIP]
====
To get the most out of a sort by score, you will need
to <<search-dsl-predicate-common-score,assign weight to your predicates by boosting some of them>>.

Advanced users may even want to change the scoring formula by specifying a different <<backend-lucene-analysis-similarity,Similarity>>.
====

Sorting by score is the default, so it's generally not necessary to ask for a sort by score explicitly,
but below is an example of how you can do it.

.Sorting by relevance
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=score]
----
====

=== Options

* You can sort by ascending score by <<search-dsl-sort-common-order,changing the sort order>>.
However, this means the least relevant hits will appear first,
which is completely pointless. This option is only provided for completeness.

[[search-dsl-sort-index-order]]
== `indexOrder`: sort according to the order of documents on storage

`indexOrder` sorts on the position of documents on internal storage.

This sort is not predictable, but is the most efficient.
Use it when performance matters more than the order of hits.

====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=indexOrder]
----
====

NOTE: `indexOrder` should *not* be used to stabilize sorts.
That's because the index order may change when the index is updated,
or even without any change, after index segments are <<backend-lucene-io-merge,merged>>.
See <<search-dsl-sort-stabilize>> for a solution to unstable sorts.

[[search-dsl-sort-field]]
== `field`: sort by field values

`field` sorts on the value of a given field for each document.

* in ascending order (the default), documents with a lower value appear first in the list of hits.
* in descending order, documents with a higher value appear first in the list of hits.

[NOTE]
====
For text fields, "lower" means "lower in the alphabetical order".
====

[[search-dsl-sort-field-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

In order for the `field` sort to be available on a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-sortable,sortable>> in the mapping.

<<mapper-orm-geopoint,Geopoint>> fields cannot be marked as sortable;
refer to the <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance sort>> for these fields.

<<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-annotations-fulltextfield,full-text fields>> (multi-word text fields)
cannot be marked as sortable;
you need to use <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-annotations-keywordfield,keyword fields>> for text sorts.
Remember you can <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-basics,map a single property to multiple fields with different names>>,
so you can have a full-text field for predicates along with a keyword field for sorts,
all for the same property.

but can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-order,controlled explicitly with `.asc()`/`.desc()`>>.
* The behavior on missing values
can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-missing,controlled explicitly with `.missing()`>>.
* The behavior on multi-valued fields
can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-multi-value-mode,controlled explicitly with `.mode(...)`>>.
* For fields in nested objects, all nested objects are considered by default,
but that can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-filter,controlled explicitly with `.filter(...)`>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-distance]]
== `distance`: sort by distance to a point

`distance` sorts on the distance from a given center to the geo-point value of a given field for each document.

* in ascending order (the default), documents with a lower distance appear first in the list of hits.
* in descending order, documents with a higher distance appear first in the list of hits.

[[search-dsl-sort-distance-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

In order for the `distance` sort to be available on a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-sortable,sortable>> in the mapping.

[[search-dsl-sort-composite]]
== `composite`: combine sorts

`composite` applies multiple sorts one after the other.
It is useful when applying incomplete sorts.

.Sorting by multiple composed sorts using `composite()`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=composite]
----
<1> Start a `composite` sort.
<2> Add a `field` sort on the `genre_sort` field.
Since many books share the same genre, this sort is incomplete:
the relative order of books with the same genre is undetermined,
and may change from one query execution to the other.
<3> Add a `field` sort on the `title_sort` field.
When two books have the same genre,
their relative order will by determined by comparing their titles.
If two books can have the same title,
we can <<search-dsl-sort-stabilize,stabilize the sort even further by adding a last sort on the id>>.
<4> The hits will be sorted by genre, then by title.
====

Alternatively, you can append a sort to another simply by calling `.then()` after the first sort:

[[search-dsl-sort-composite-lambda]]
=== Adding sorts dynamically with the lambda syntax

It is possible to define the `composite` sort inside a lambda expression.
This is especially useful when inner sorts need to be added dynamically to the `composite` sort,
for example based on user input.

.Easily composing sorts dynamically with the lambda syntax
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=composite_dynamicParameters]
----
<1> Get a custom object holding the search parameters provided by the user through a web form, for example.
<2> Call `.composite(Consumer)`.
The consumer, implemented by a lambda expression, will receive a builder as an argument
and will add sorts to that builder as necessary.
<3> Inside the lambda, the code is free to do whatever is necessary before adding sorts.
In this case, we iterate over user-selected sorts and add sorts accordingly.
<4> The hits will be sorted according to sorts added by the lambda expression.
====

[[search-dsl-sort-stabilize]]
=== Stabilizing a sort

If your first sort (e.g. by <<search-dsl-sort-field,field value>>)
results in a tie for many documents (e.g. many documents have the same field value),
you may want to append an arbitrary sort just to stabilize your sort:
to make sure the search hits will always be in the same order if you execute the same query.

In most cases, a quick and easy solution for stabilizing a sort is
to change your mapping to add a <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-sortable,sortable field>> on your entity ID,
and to append a `field` sort by id to your unstable sort:

[[search-dsl-sort-extensions]]
== Backend-specific extensions

By calling `.extension(...)` while building a query,
it is possible to access backend-specific sorts.

[NOTE]

As their name suggests, backend-specific sorts are not portable from one backend technology to the other.

[[search-dsl-sort-common]]
== Options common to multiple sort types

[[search-dsl-sort-common-order]]
=== Sort order

Most sorts use the ascending order by default, with the notable exception of the <<search-dsl-sort-score,score sort>>.

The order controlled explicitly through the following options:

* `.asc()` for an ascending order.
* `.desc()` for a descending order.
* `.order(...)` for an order defined by the given argument: `SortOrder.ASC`/`SortOrder.DESC`.

Below are a few examples with the <<search-dsl-sort-field,field sort>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-common-missing]]
=== Missing values
// Search 5 anchors backward compatibility
[[_handling_missing_values]]

Documents that do not have any value for a sort field will appear in the last position by default.

The behavior for missing values can be controlled explicitly through the `.missing()` option:

* `.missing().first()` puts documents with no value in first position (regardless of the sort order).
* `.missing().last()` puts documents with no value in last position (regardless of the sort order).
* `.missing().use(...)` uses the given value as a default for documents with no value.

Below are a few examples with the <<search-dsl-sort-field,field sort>>.

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=missing-use]
----
====

[[search-dsl-sort-common-missing-argument-type]]
==== Expected type of arguments

By default, `.use(...)` expects its argument to have the same type as
the entity property corresponding to the target field.

For example, if an entity property is of type `java.util.Date`,
<<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-supported-types,the corresponding field may be of type `java.time.Instant`>>.
`.use(...)` will expect its argument to be of type `java.util.Date` regardless.

This should generally be what you want,
but if you ever need to bypass conversion and pass an unconverted argument
(of type `java.time.Instant` in the example above)
to `.use(...)`, see <<search-dsl-argument-type>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-common-multi-value-mode]]
=== Sort mode for multi-valued fields

Documents that have multiple values for a sort field can be sorted too.
A single value is picked for each document in order to compare it with order documents.
How the value is picked is called the *sort mode*, specified using the `.mode(...)` option.
The following sort modes are available:

|====
|Mode|Description|Supported value types|Unsupported value types
|`SortMode.MIN`
|Picks the lowest value for field sorts, the lowest distance for distance sorts.

This is default for ascending sorts.
|All.
|-
|`SortMode.MAX`
|Picks the highest value for field sorts, the highest distance for distance sorts.

This is default for descending sorts.
|All.
|-
|`SortMode.SUM`
|Computes the sum of all values for each document,
and picks that sum for comparison with other documents.
|Numeric fields (`long`, ...).
|Text and temporal fields (`String`, `LocalDate`, ...), <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance>>.
|`SortMode.AVG`
|Computes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean[arithmetic mean] of all values for each document
and picks that average for comparison with other documents.
|Numeric and temporal fields (`long`, `LocalDate`, ...), <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance>>.
|Text fields (`String`, ...).
|`SortMode.MEDIAN`
|Computes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median[median] of all values for each document,
and picks that median for comparison with other documents.
|Numeric and temporal fields (`long`, `LocalDate`, ...), <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance>>.
|Text fields (`String`, ...).
|====

Below is an example with the <<search-dsl-sort-field,field sort>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-common-filter]]
=== Filter for fields in nested objects

When the sort field is located in a <<mapper-orm-indexedembedded-structure-nested,nested object>>,
by default all nested objects will be considered for the sort
and their values will be combined using the configured <<search-dsl-sort-common-multi-value-mode,sort mode>>.

It is possible to filter the nested documents whose values will be considered for the sort
using one of the `filter(...)` methods.

Below is an example with the <<search-dsl-sort-field,field sort>>:
authors are sorted by the average page count of their books,
but only books of the "crime fiction" genre are considered:
