[[search-dsl-projection-concepts]]
== Basics

For some use cases, you only need the query to return a small subset of the data contained in your domain object.
In these cases, returning managed entities and extracting data from these entities may be overkill:
extracting the data from the index itself would avoid the database round-trip.

Projections do just that: they allow the query to return something more precise than just "the matching entities".
Projections can be configured when building the search query:

.Using projections to extract data from the index

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=entryPoint-lambdas]
----
<1> Start building the query as usual.
<2> Mention that the expected result of the query is a projection on field "title", of type String.
If that type is not appropriate or if the field does not exist, an exception will be thrown.
<3> Fetch the results, which will have the expected type.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use lambdas:

----
====

[NOTE]
====
There are a few constraints regarding `field` projections.
In particular, in order for a field to be "projectable", it must either be <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-projectable,explicitly marked as such in the mapping>>,
or be implicitly projectable based on the underlying backend (Elasticsearch),
so that it is correctly stored in the index.
====

While `field` projections are certainly the most common,
they are not the only type of projection.
Other projections allow
<<search-dsl-projection-composite,composing custom beans containing extracted data>>,
get references to the <<search-dsl-projection-documentReference,extracted documents>>
or the <<search-dsl-projection-reference,corresponding entities>>,
or get information related to the search query itself
(<<search-dsl-projection-score,score>>, ...).

To learn more about the field projection, and all the other types of projection,
refer to the following sections.

[[search-dsl-projection-documentReference]]
== `documentReference`: return references to matched documents

The `documentReference` projection returns a reference to the matched document as a `DocumentReference` object.

.Returning references to matched documents
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=documentReference]
----
====

NOTE: Since it's a reference to the _document_, not the entity,
`DocumentReference` only exposes low-level concepts such as the type name and the document identifier (a `String`).
Use the <<search-dsl-projection-reference,`entityReference`>> projection to get a reference to the entity.

[[search-dsl-projection-reference]]
== `entityReference`: return references to matched entities

The `entityReference` projection returns a reference to the matched entity as an `EntityReference` object.

.Returning references to matched entities
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=reference]
----
====

NOTE: The entity does not get loaded as part of the projection.
If you want the actual entity instance, use the <<search-dsl-projection-entity,`entity` projection>>

[[search-dsl-projection-id]]
== [[_id_return_identifiers_of_matched_entities]] `id`: return identifiers of matched entities

The `identifier` projection returns the identifier of the matched entity.

.Returning ids to matched entities, providing the identity type.
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=id-int]
----
====
If the provided identifier type does not match the type of identifiers for targeted entity types,
an exception will be thrown. See also <<search-dsl-projected-value-type>>. 

You can omit the "identifier type" argument, but then you will get projections of type `Object`:

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=id-object]
----
====

[[search-dsl-projection-entity]]
== `entity`: return matched entities

The `entityReference` projection returns the entity corresponding to the document that matched.

NOTE: With the Hibernate ORM integration, returned objects are managed entities loaded from the database.
You can use them as you would use any entity returned from traditional Hibernate ORM queries.

.Returning matched entities loaded from the database
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=entity]
----
====

NOTE: If an entity cannot be loaded (e.g. it was deleted and the index wasn't updated yet),
the hit will be omitted and won't appear in the returned `List` at all.
The total hit count, however, will not take this omission into account.

[[search-dsl-projection-field]]
== `field`: return field values from matched documents

The `field` projection returns the value of a given field for the matched document.

[[search-dsl-projection-field-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

In order for the `field` projection to be available on a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-projectable,projectable>> in the mapping.

[[search-dsl-projection-field-syntax]]
=== Syntax

By default, the `field` projection returns a single value per document,
so the code below will be enough for a single-valued field:

.Returning field values from matched documents
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=field]
----
====

NOTE: Hibernate Search will throw an exception when building the query if you do this on a multivalued field.
To project on multivalued fields, see <<search-dsl-projection-field-multivalued>>.

You can omit the "field type" argument, but then you will get projections of type `Object`:

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=field-noType]
----
====

[[search-dsl-projection-field-multivalued]]
=== Multivalued fields

To return multiple values, and thus allow projection on multivalued fields, use `.multi()`.
This will change the return type of the projection to `List<T>` where `T` is what the single-valued projection
would have returned.

.Returning field values from matched documents, for multivalued fields
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=field-multiValued]
----
====

[[search-dsl-projection-field-skipping-conversion]]
=== Skipping conversion

By default, the values returned by the `field` projection have the same type as
the entity property corresponding to the target field.

For example, if an entity property if of an enum type,
<<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-supported-types,the corresponding field may be of type `String`>>;
the values returned by the `field` projection will be of the enum type regardless.

This should generally be what you want,
but if you ever need to bypass conversion and have unconverted values returned to you instead
(of type `String` in the example above),
you can do it this way:

----

See <<search-dsl-projected-value-type>> for more information.

[[search-dsl-projection-score]]
== `score`: return the score of matched documents

The `score` projection returns the <<search-dsl-predicate-common-score,score>> of the matched document.

.Returning the score of matched documents
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=score]
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Two scores can only be reliably compared if they were computed during the very same query execution.
Trying to compare scores from two separate query executions will only lead to confusing results,
in particular if the predicates are different or
if the content of the index changed enough to alter the frequency of some terms significantly.

On a related note, exposing scores to end users is generally not an easy task.
See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/LUCENE/ScoresAsPercentages[this article] for some insight
into what's wrong with displaying the score as a percentage, specifically.
====

[[search-dsl-projection-distance]]
== `distance`: return the distance to a point

The `distance` projection returns the distance between a given point
and the geo-point value of a given field for the matched document.

[[search-dsl-projection-distance-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

In order for the `distance` projection to be available on a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-projectable,projectable>> in the mapping.

[[search-dsl-projection-distance-syntax]]
=== Syntax

By default, the `distance` projection returns a single value per document,
so the code below will be enough for a single-valued field:

.Returning the distance to a point
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=distance]
----
====

NOTE: Hibernate Search will throw an exception when building the query if you do this on a multivalued field.
To project on multivalued fields, see <<search-dsl-projection-distance-multivalued>>.

The returned distance is in meters by default, but you can pick a different unit:

.Returning the distance to a point with a given distance unit

[[search-dsl-projection-distance-multivalued]]
=== Multivalued fields

To return multiple values, and thus allow projection on multivalued fields, use `.multi()`.
This will change the return type of the projection to `List<Double>`.

[[search-dsl-projection-composite]]
== `composite`: combine projections

[[search-dsl-projection-composite-basics]]
=== Basics

The `composite` projection applies multiple projections and combines their results,
either as a `List<?>` or as a single object generated using a custom transformer.

To preserve type-safety, you can provide a custom transformer.
The transformer can be a `Function`, a `BiFunction`,
or a `org.hibernate.search.util.common.function.TriFunction`,
depending on the number of inner projections.
It will receive values returned by inner projections and return an object combining these values.

.Returning custom objects created from multiple projected values with `.composite().from(...).as(...)`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=composite-customObject]
----
<1> Call `.composite()`.
<2> Define the first inner projection as a projection on the `title` field.
<3> Define the second inner projection as a projection on the `genre` field.
<4> Define the result of the composite projection as the result of calling the constructor of a custom object, `MyPair`.
The constructor of `MyPair` will be called for each matched document,
with the value of the `title` field as its first argument,
and the value of the `genre` field as its second argument.
<5> Each hit will be an instance of `MyPair`.
Thus, the list of hits will be an instance of `List<MyPair>`.
====

[[search-dsl-projection-composite-more-inners]]
=== Composing more than 3 inner projections

If you pass more than 3 projections as arguments to `from(...)`,
then the transform function will have to take a `List<?>` as an argument,
and will be set using `asList(...)` instead of `as(..,)`:

.Returning custom objects created from multiple projected values with `.composite().from(...).asList(...)`

<4> Define the third inner projection as a projection on the `pageCount` field.
<5> Define the fourth inner projection as a projection on the `description` field.
<6> Define the result of the object projection as the result of calling a lambda.
The lambda will take elements of the list (the results of projections defined above, in order),
cast them, and pass them to the constructor of a custom class, `MyTuple4`.
<7> Each hit will be an instance of `MyTuple4`.
Thus, the list of hits will be an instance of `List<MyTuple4>`.
====

[[search-dsl-projection-composite-as-list]]
=== Projecting to a `List<?>` or `Object[]`

If you don't mind receiving the result of inner projections as a `List<?>`,
you can do without the transformer by calling `asList()`:

.Returning a `List` of projected values with `.composite().add(...).asList()`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=composite-list]
----
<1> Call `.composite()`.
<2> Define the first inner projection as a projection on the `title` field.
<3> Define the second inner projection as a projection on the `genre` field.
<4> Define the result of the projection as a list,
meaning the hits will be `List` instances with the value of the `title` field of the matched document at index `0`,
and the value of the `genre` field of the matched document at index `1`.
<5> Each hit will be an instance of `List<?>`:
a list containing the result of the inner projections, in the given order.
Thus, the list of hits will be an instance of `List<List<?>>`.
====

Similarly, to get the result of inner projections as an array (`Object[]`),
you can do without the transformer by calling `asArray()`:

.Returning an array of projected values with `.composite(...).add(...).asArray()`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/ProjectionDslIT.java[tags=composite-array]
----
<1> Call `.composite()`.
<2> Define the first inner projection as a projection on the `title` field.
<3> Define the second inner projection as a projection on the `genre` field.
<4> Define the result of the projection as an array,
meaning the hits will be `Object[]` instances with the value of the `title` field of the matched document at index `0`,
and the value of the `genre` field of the matched document at index `1`.
<5> Each hit will be an instance of `Object[]`:
a array of objects containing the result of the inner projections, in the given order.
Thus, the list of hits will be an instance of `List<Object[]>`.
====

Alternatively, to get the result as a `List<?>`,
you can use the shorter variant of `.composite(...)` that directly takes projections as arguments:

====

[[search-dsl-projection-object]]
== `object`: return one value per object in an object field

The `object` projection yields one projected value for each object in a given object field,
the value being generated by applying multiple inner projections and combining their results
either as a `List<?>` or as a single object generated using a custom transformer.

[NOTE]
====
The `object` projection may seem very similar to the <<search-dsl-projection-composite,`composite` projection>>,
and its definition via the Search DSL certainly is indeed similar.

However, there are two key differences:

1. The `object` projection will yield `null` when projecting on a single-valued object field
   if the object was null when indexing.
2. The `object` projection will yield multiple values when projecting on a multivalued object field
   if there were multiple objects when indexing.
====

[WARNING]
====
With the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>>, the object projection has a few limitations:

1. It is only available for object fields with a
<<mapper-orm-indexedembedded-structure-nested,`NESTED` structure>>.
2. It will never yield `null` objects for multi-valued object fields.
The Lucene backend does not index `null` objects,
and thus cannot find them when searching.

These limitations do not apply to the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>>.
====

[[search-dsl-projection-object-syntax]]
=== Syntax

To preserve type-safety, you can provide a custom transformer.
The transformer can be a `Function`, a `BiFunction`,
or a `org.hibernate.search.util.common.function.TriFunction`,
depending on the number of inner projections.
It will receive values returned by inner projections and return an object combining these values.

with the value of the `authors.firstName` field as its first argument,
and the value of the `authors.lastName` field as its second argument.

The `constant` projection returns the same value for every single document,

[NOTE]
====
The returned document is similar to the one that was indexed.

For example, if a value was transformed by the `toIndexedValue` method
of a <<mapper-orm-bridge-valuebridge,value bridge>> upon indexing,
this transformed value (after encoding) will be the value included in the document:
Hibernate Search will not convert it back using `ValueBridge#fromIndexedValue`.

However, there are some differences between the returned document and the one that was indexed:

* Only stored fields are present.
* Even stored fields may not have the same `FieldType` as they originally had.
* The document structure flattened,
i.e. even fields from <<mapper-orm-indexedembedded-structure-nested,nested documents>>
are all added to same returned document.
* <<mapper-orm-bridge-index-field-dsl-dynamic,Dynamic fields>> may be missing.

If you want a projection that retrieves the value as it was in your entity upon indexing,

[NOTE]
====
The source is returned exactly as it appears in the response from Elasticsearch.
In particular, Hibernate Search will not apply any kind of the conversions
described in <<search-dsl-projected-value-type>>.

For example, if a value was transformed by the `toIndexedValue` method
of a <<mapper-orm-bridge-valuebridge,value bridge>> upon indexing,
this transformed value will be the value included in the source:
Hibernate Search will not convert it back using `ValueBridge#fromIndexedValue`.

If you want a projection that retrieves the value as it was in your entity upon indexing,
use a <<search-dsl-projection-field,`field` projection>>.

[[search-dsl-projection-extensions-elasticsearch-jsonHit]]
=== Elasticsearch: `jsonHit`

The `.jsonHit()` projection returns the exact JSON returned by Elasticsearch for the hit, as a `JsonObject`.

[NOTE]
====
This is particularly useful when <<search-dsl-query-elasticsearch-json,customizing the request's JSON>>
to ask for additional data within each hit.
