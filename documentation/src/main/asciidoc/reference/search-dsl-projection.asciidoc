== Basics

For some use cases, you only need the query to return a small subset of the data contained in your domain object.
In these cases, returning managed entities and extracting data from these entities may be overkill:
extracting the data from the index itself would avoid the database round-trip.

Projections do just that: they allow the query to return something more precise than just "the matching entities".
Projections can be configured when building the search query:

If that type is not appropriate or if the field does not exist, an exception will be thrown.
<4> Fetch the results, which will have the expected type.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use lambdas:

While `field` projections are certainly the most common,
they are not the only type of projection.
Other projections allow
<<search-dsl-projection-composite,composing custom beans containing extracted data>>,
getting references to the <<search-dsl-projection-documentReference,extracted documents>>
or the <<search-dsl-projection-reference,corresponding entities>>,
or getting information related to the search query itself
(<<search-dsl-projection-score,score>>, ...).

== Projecting to a custom (annotated) type

For more complex projections, it is possible to <<mapping-projection,define a custom (annotated) record or class>>
and have Hibernate Search infer the corresponding projections from the custom type's constructor parameters.

or at the constructor level (if there are <<mapping-projection-multiple-constructors,multiple constructors>>).
<2> To project on the entity identifier, annotate the relevant constructor parameter with <<search-dsl-projection-id-mapping,`@IdProjection`>>.

Most projections have a corresponding annotation that can be used on constructor parameters.
<3> To project on a value field, add a constructor parameter named after that field and with the same type as that field.
See <<mapping-projection-inner-inference>> for more information on how constructor parameters should be defined.

Alternatively, the field projection can be configured explicitly with <<search-dsl-projection-field-mapping,`@FieldProjection`>>.
<4> To project on an object field, add a constructor parameter named after that field and with its own custom projection type.
Multivalued projections <<mapping-projection-inner-inference-type,must be modeled as a `List<...>`>> or supertype.

Alternatively, the object projection can be configured explicitly with <<search-dsl-projection-object-mapping,`@ObjectProjection`>>.
<5> Annotate any custom projection type used for object fields with `@ProjectionConstructor` as well.

[[search-dsl-projection-entity]]
== `entity`: return matched entities

The `entity` projection returns the entity corresponding to the document that matched.

How the entity is loaded exactly depends on your mapper and configuration:

* With the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>, returned objects are managed entities loaded by Hibernate ORM from the database.
You can use them as you would use any entity returned from traditional Hibernate ORM queries.
* With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
entities are loaded from an external datastore if <<mapper-pojo-standalone-search-query-loading,configured>>,
or (failing that) are projected from the index if the entity type declares a <<mapping-projection,projection constructor>>.
If neither loading configuration nor projection constructor are found,
the `entity` projection will simply fail.

NOTE: If an entity cannot be loaded from the external datastore/database
(e.g. it was deleted there, and the index wasn't updated yet),
the hit will be omitted and won't appear in the returned `List` at all.
The total hit count, however, will not take this omission into account.

[[search-dsl-projection-entity-requested-type]]
=== Requesting a specific entity type

In some (rare) cases, the code creating the projection
may have to work with a `SearchProjectionFactory<?, ?>`,
i.e. a factory that carries no information regarding the type of loaded entities.

In those cases, it's possible to request a specific type of entities:
Hibernate Search will check when the projection is created that
the requested type matches the type of loaded entities.

the values returned by the `field` projection will be of the enum type regardless.

This should generally be what you want,
but if you ever need to bypass conversion and have unconverted values returned to you instead
(of type `String` in the example above),
you can do it this way:

[[search-dsl-projection-field-mapping]]
=== `@FieldProjection` in projections to custom types

To achieve a `field` projection inside a <<search-dsl-projection-mapped,projection to an annotated custom type>>,
you can rely on the default <<mapping-projection-inner-inference,inferred projection>>:
when no annotations are present on a constructor parameter,
it will be inferred to a field projection to the field with the same name as the constructor parameter
(or an <<search-dsl-projection-object,object projection>>,
see <<mapping-projection-inner-inference-type,here for details>>).

To force a field projection,
or to customize the field projection further (for example to set the field path explicitly),
use the `@FieldProjection` annotation on the constructor parameter:

=== Basics

The `composite` projection applies multiple projections and combines their results,
either as a `List<?>` or as a single object generated using a custom transformer.

To preserve type-safety, you can provide a custom transformer.
The transformer can be a `Function`, a `BiFunction`,
or a `org.hibernate.search.util.common.function.TriFunction`,
depending on the number of inner projections.
It will receive values returned by inner projections and return an object combining these values.

== `object`: return one value per object in an object field

The `object` projection yields one projected value for each object in a given object field,
the value being generated by applying multiple inner projections and combining their results
either as a `List<?>` or as a single object generated using a custom transformer.

[NOTE]
====
The `object` projection may seem very similar to the <<search-dsl-projection-composite,`composite` projection>>,
and its definition via the Search DSL certainly is indeed similar.

However, there are two key differences:

1. The `object` projection will yield `null` when projecting on a single-valued object field
   if the object was null when indexing.
2. The `object` projection will yield multiple values when projecting on a multivalued object field
   if there were multiple objects when indexing.
====

[WARNING]
====
With the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>>, the object projection has a few limitations:

1. It is only available for single-valued object fields regardless of their <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure,structure>>,
or multi-valued object fields with a
<<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-nested,`NESTED` structure>>.
2. It will never yield `null` objects for multi-valued object fields.
The Lucene backend does not index `null` objects,
and thus cannot find them when searching.

These limitations do not apply to the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>>.
====

[[search-dsl-projection-object-syntax]]
=== Syntax

To preserve type-safety, you can provide a custom transformer.
The transformer can be a `Function`, a `BiFunction`,
or a `org.hibernate.search.util.common.function.TriFunction`,
depending on the number of inner projections.
It will receive values returned by inner projections and return an object combining these values.

[NOTE]
====
The source is returned exactly as it appears in the response from Elasticsearch.
In particular, Hibernate Search will not apply any kind of the conversions
described in <<search-dsl-projected-value-type>>.

For example, if a value was transformed by the `toIndexedValue` method
of a <<binding-valuebridge,value bridge>> upon indexing,
this transformed value will be the value included in the source:
Hibernate Search will not convert it back using `ValueBridge#fromIndexedValue`.

If you want a projection that retrieves the value as it was in your entity upon indexing,
use a <<search-dsl-projection-field,`field` projection>>.

The `.jsonHit()` projection returns the exact JSON returned by Elasticsearch for the hit, as a `JsonObject`.

[NOTE]
====
This is particularly useful when <<search-dsl-query-elasticsearch-json,customizing the request's JSON>>
to ask for additional data within each hit.
