== Type of arguments passed to the DSL

Some predicates, such as the `match` predicate or the `range` predicate,
require a parameter of type `Object` at some point (`matching(Object)`, `atLeast(Object)`, ...).
Similarly, it is possible to pass an argument of type `Object` in the sort DSL
when defining the behavior for missing values (`missing().use(Object)`).

These methods do not actually accept *any* object,
and will throw an exception when passed an argument with the wrong type.

Generally the expected type of this argument should be rather obvious:
for example if you created a field by mapping an `Integer` property,
then an `Integer` value will be expected when building a predicate;
if you mapped a `java.time.LocalDate`, then a `java.time.LocalDate` will be expected,
etc.

Things get a little more complex if you start defining and using custom bridges.
You will then have properties of type `A` mapped to an index field of type `B`.
What should you pass to the DSL?
To answer that question, we need to understand DSL converters.

DSL converters are a feature of Hibernate Search that allows the DSL to accept
arguments that match the type of the indexed property,
instead of the type of the underlying index field.

Each custom bridge has the possibility to define a DSL converter for the index fields it populates.
When it does, every time that field is mentioned in the predicate DSL,
Hibernate Search will use that DSL converter to convert the value passed to the DSL to a value that the backend understands.

For example, let's imagine an `AuthenticationEvent` entity with an `outcome` property of type `AuthenticationOutcome`.
This `AuthenticationOutcome` type is an enum.
We index the `AuthenticationEvent` entity and its `outcome` property in order to allow users to find events by their outcome.

The default bridge for enums puts the result of `Enum.name()` into a `String` field.
However, this default bridge also defines a DSL converter under the hood.
As a result, any call to the DSL will be expected to pass an `AuthenticationOutcome` instance:

This is handy, and especially appropriate if users are asked to select an outcome in a list of choices.
But what if we want users to type in some words instead, i.e. what if we want full-text search on the `outcome` field?
Then we will not have an `AuthenticationOutcome` instance to pass to the DSL, only a `String`...

In that case, we will first need to assign some text to each enum.
This can be achieved by defining a custom <<binding-valuebridge,`ValueBridge<AuthenticationOutcome, String>`>>
and applying it to the `outcome` property to index a textual description of the outcome,
instead of the default `Enum#name()`.

Then, we will need to tell Hibernate Search that the value passed to the DSL should not be passed to the DSL converter,
but should be assumed to match the type of the index field directly (in this case, `String`).
To that end, one can simply use the variant of the `matching` method that accepts a `ValueConvert` parameter,
and pass `ValueConvert.NO`:

All methods that apply DSL converters offer a variant that accepts a `ValueConvert` parameter:
`matching`, `between`, `atLeast`, `atMost`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`, `range`, ...

[NOTE]
====
A DSL converter is always automatically generated for value bridges.
However, more complex bridges will require explicit configuration.

See <<binding-typebridge>> or <<binding-propertybridge>> for more information.

[[search-dsl-projected-value-type]]
== Type of projected values

Generally the type of values returned by projections should be rather obvious:
for example if you created a field by mapping an `Integer` property,
then an `Integer` value will be returned when projecting;
if you mapped a `java.time.LocalDate`, then a `java.time.LocalDate` will be returned,
etc.

Things get a little more complex if you start defining and using custom bridges.
You will then have properties of type `A` mapped to an index field of type `B`.
What will be returned by projections?
To answer that question, we need to understand projection converters.

Projection converters are a feature of Hibernate Search that allows the projections to return
values that match the type of the indexed property,
instead of the type of the underlying index field.

Each custom bridge has the possibility to define a projection converter for the index fields it populates.
When it does, every time that field is projected on,
Hibernate Search will use that projection converter to convert the projected value returned by the index.

For example, let's imagine an `Order` entity with a `status` property of type `OrderStatus`.
This `OrderStatus` type is an enum.
We index the `Order` entity and its `status` property.

The default bridge for enums puts the result of `Enum.name()` into a `String` field.
However, this default bridge also defines a projection converter.
As a result, any projection on the `status` field will return an `OrderStatus` instance:

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/converter/ProjectionConverterIT.java[tags=projection-converter-enabled]

This is probably what you want in general.
But in some cases, you may want to disable this conversion and return the index value instead
(i.e. the value of `Enum.name()`).

In that case, we will need to tell Hibernate Search that the value returned by the backend should not be passed to the projection converter.
To that end, one can simply use the variant of the `field` method that accepts a `ValueConvert` parameter,
and pass `ValueConvert.NO`:

Projection converters must be configured explicitly in custom bridges.

[[search-dsl-multiple-fields]]
== Targeting multiple fields

Sometimes a predicate/sort/projection targets *multiple* field, which may have conflicting definitions:

* when multiple field names are passed to the `fields` method in the predicate DSL (each field has its own definition);
* or when the search query <<search-dsl-query-targeting-multiple,targets multiple indexes>> (each index has its own definition of each field).

In such cases, the definition of the targeted fields is expected to be compatible.
For example targeting an `Integer` field and a `java.time.LocalDate` field
in the same `match` predicate will not work,
because you won't be able to pass a non-null argument to the `matching(Object)` method
that is both an `Integer` and a `java.time.LocalDate`.

If you are looking for a simple rule of thumb, here it is:
if the indexed properties do not have the same type, or are mapped differently,
the corresponding fields are probably not going to be compatible.

However, if you're interested in the details, Hibernate Search is a bit more flexible than that.

There are three different constraints when it comes to field compatibility:

1. The fields must be "encoded" in a compatible way.
This means the backend must use the same representation for the two fields,
for example they are both `Integer`,
or they are both `BigDecimal` with the same decimal scale,
or they are both `LocalDate` with the same date format, etc.
2. The fields must have a compatible DSL converter (for predicates and sorts) or projection converter (for projections).
3. For full-text predicates, the fields must have a compatible analyzer.

The following sections describe all the possible incompatibilities, and how to solve them.

[[search-dsl-multiple-fields-incompatible-codec]]
=== [[_incompatible_codec]] Incompatible codec

In a search query targeting multiple indexes,
if a field is encoded differently in each index,
you cannot apply predicates, sorts or projections on that field.

NOTE: Encoding is not only about the field type, such as `LocalDate` or `BigDecimal`.
Some codecs are parameterized and two codecs with different parameters will often be considered incompatible.
Examples of parameters include the format for temporal types
or the <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-scalednumberfield, decimal scale>>
for `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger`.

In that case, your only option is to change your mapping to avoid the conflict:

1. rename the field in one index
2. OR change the field type in one index
3. OR if the problem is simply different codec parameters (date format, decimal scale, ...),
align the value of these parameters in one index with the other index.

If you choose to rename the field in one index,
you will still be able to apply a similar predicate
to the two fields in a single query:
you will have to create one predicate per field
and combine them with a <<search-dsl-predicate-boolean,boolean junction>>.

[[search-dsl-multiple-fields-incompatible-dsl-converter]]
=== [[_incompatible_dsl_converters]] Incompatible DSL converters

Incompatible DSL converters are only a problem when you need to pass an argument to the DSL in certain methods:
`matching(Object)`/`between(Object)`/`atLeast(Object)`/`greaterThan(Object)`/etc. in the predicate DSL,
`missing().use(Object) in the sort DSL,
`range(Object, Object)` in the aggregation DSL,
...

If two fields encoded in a compatible way (for example both as `String`),
but that have different DSL converters
(for example the first one converts from `String` to `String`, but the second one converts from `Integer` to `String`),
you can still use these methods, but you will need to disable the DSL converter
as explained in <<search-dsl-argument-type>>:
you will just pass the "index" value to the DSL (using the same example, a `String`).

[[search-dsl-multiple-fields-incompatible-projection-converter]]
=== [[_incompatible_projection_converters]] Incompatible projection converters

If, in a search query targeting multiple indexes,
a field is encoded in a compatible way in every index (for example both as `String`),
but that has a different projection converters
(for example the first one converts from `String` to `String`, but the second one converts from `String` to `Integer`),
you can still project on this field, but you will need to disable the projection converter
as explained in <<search-dsl-projected-value-type>>:
the projection will return the "index", unconverted value (using the same example, a `String`).

[[search-dsl-multiple-fields-incompatible-analyzer]]
=== [[_incompatible_analyzer]] Incompatible analyzer

Incompatible analyzers are only a problem with full-text predicates:
match predicate on a text field, phrase predicate, simple query string predicate, ...

If two fields encoded in a compatible way (for example both as `String`),
but that have different analyzers,
you can still use these predicates, but you will need to explicitly configure the predicate to either
set the search analyzer to an analyzer of your choosing with `.analyzer(analyzerName)`,
or skip analysis completely with `.skipAnalysis()`.

See <<search-dsl-predicate>> for more information about how to create predicates
and about the available options.
