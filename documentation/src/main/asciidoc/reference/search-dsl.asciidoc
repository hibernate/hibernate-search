Beyond simply indexing, Hibernate Search also exposes high-level APIs to search these indexes
without having to resort to native APIs.

One key feature of these search APIs is the ability to use indexes to perform the search,
but to return entities loaded *from the database*,
effectively offering a new type of query for Hibernate ORM entities.
