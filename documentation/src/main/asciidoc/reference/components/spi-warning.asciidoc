[WARNING]
====
Features detailed in this section rely on at least one _SPI_ (Service Provider Interface):
these are aimed at integration providers (typically frameworks).

The https://hibernate.org/community/compatibility-policy/[compatibility policy] is slightly different for an SPI:
SPI elements (e.g. types, methods, configuration properties, etc.)
may be altered in a backward-incompatible way -- or even removed -- in **minor** versions of Hibernate Search.

You are free to use/implement SPI if you really need it,
but you should be prepared to update code which relies on SPI as needed.
