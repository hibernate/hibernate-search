[WARNING]
====
Dynamic sharding for the database-polling coordination strategy has not been implemented yet.

In practice, this means your application must have a fixed number of nodes
participating in indexing,
and all application nodes participating in indexing
must configure <<coordination-database-polling-sharding-static,static sharding>>.

Dynamic sharding is going to be implemented in later 6.1.0.Alpha releases;
see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-4140 for progress.
