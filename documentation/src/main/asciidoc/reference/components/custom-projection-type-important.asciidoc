[IMPORTANT]
====
There are a few constraints to keep in mind when annotating a custom projection type:

* The custom projection type must be in the same JAR as entity types,
or Hibernate Search will <<mapping-projection-type-detection,require additional configuration>>.
* The custom projection type must be compiled in such a way that
<<mapping-projection-inner-inference-basics,constructor parameter names are included in the Java bytecode>>.
* When projecting on value fields, the constraints of the <<search-dsl-projection-field,`field`>> projection still apply.
In particular, with the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>>, value fields involved in the projection
must be configured as <<mapping-directfieldmapping-projectable,projectable>>.
* When projecting on object fields, the constraints of the <<search-dsl-projection-object,`object`>> projection still apply.
In particular, with the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>>, object fields involved in the projection
must be configured as <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-nested,nested>>.
