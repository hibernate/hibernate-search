[WARNING]
====
This feature implies that application code rely on Lucene APIs directly.

An upgrade of Hibernate Search, even for a bugfix (micro) release,
may require an upgrade of Lucene,
which may lead to breaking API changes in Lucene.

If this happens, you will need to change application code to deal with the changes.
