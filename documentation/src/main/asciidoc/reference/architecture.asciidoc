[[architecture-hsearch-components]]
== [[_overview]] Components of Hibernate Search

From the user's perspective, Hibernate Search consists of two components:

[[architecture-hsearch-components-mapper]]Mapper:: The mapper "maps" the user model to an index model,
and provide APIs consistent with the user model to perform indexing and searching.
+
Most applications rely on the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM mapper>>,
which offers the ability to index properties of Hibernate ORM entities,
but there is also a <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO mapper>>
that can be used without Hibernate ORM.
+
The mapper is configured partly through annotations on the domain model,
and partly through configuration properties.
Backend:: The backend is the abstraction over the full-text engines, where "things get done".
It implements generic indexing and searching interfaces for use by the mapper
through "index managers", each providing access to one index.
+
For instance the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>> delegates to the Lucene library,
and the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>> delegates to a remote Elasticsearch cluster.
+
The backend is configured partly by the mapper,
which tells the backend which indexes must exist and what fields they must have,
and partly through configuration properties.

The mapper and backend work together to provide three main features:

Mass indexing::
This is how Hibernate Search rebuilds indexes from zero based on the content of a database.
+
The mapper queries the database to retrieve the identifier of every entity,
then processes these identifiers in batches,
loading the entities then processing them to generate documents that are sent to the backend for indexing.
The backend puts the document in an internal queue, and will index documents in batches, in background processes,
notifying the mapper when it's done.
+
See <<indexing-massindexer>> for details.
Automatic indexing::
This is how Hibernate Search keeps indexes in sync with a database with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>.
+
When an entity changes, the mapper detects the change and stores the information in an indexing plan.
Upon transaction commit, these changes processed (either in the same thread or in a background process,
depending on the <<coordination,coordination strategy>>),
and documents are generated, then sent to the backend for indexing.
The backend puts the documents in an internal queue, and will index documents in batches, in background processes,
notifying the mapper when it's done.
+
See <<indexing-automatic>> for details.
+
NOTE: Automatic indexing is <<mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-automatic,not available for the Standalone POJO Mapper>>.
Searching::
This is how Hibernate Search provides ways to query an index.
+
The mapper exposes entry points to the search DSL, allowing selection of entity types to query.
When one or more entity types are selected,
the mapper delegates to the corresponding index managers to provide a Search DSL
and ultimately create the search query.
Upon query execution, the backend submits a list of entity references to the mapper,
which loads the corresponding entities.
The entities are then returned by the query.
+
See <<search-dsl>> for details.

[[architecture-examples-single-node-lucene]]
=== [[architecture-examples-lucene]] [[_lucene]] Single-node application with the Lucene backend

[[architecture-examples-single-node-lucene-description]]
==== Description

With the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>>, indexes are local to a given application node (JVM).
They are accessed through direct calls to the Lucene library,
without going through the network.

image::architecture-single-node-lucene.png[Simple architecture with Lucene backend,align="center"]

This mode is only relevant to single-node applications.

[[architecture-examples-single-node-lucene-pros-and-cons]]
==== Pros and cons

Pros:

* Simplicity: no external services are required, everything lives on the same server.
* <<backend-lucene-io-refresh,Immediate visibility>> (~milliseconds) of index updates.
While other architectures can perform comparably well for most use cases,
a single-node, Lucene backend is the best way to implement indexing
if you need changes to be visible immediately after the database changes.

Cons:

* <<limitations-backend-indexing-error>>.
* <<limitations-parallel-embedded-update>>.
* Not so easy to extend: experienced developers can access a lot of Lucene features,
even those that are not exposed by Hibernate Search, by providing native Lucene objects;
however, Lucene APIs are not very easy to figure out for developers unfamiliar with Lucene.
If you're interested, see for example <<search-dsl-predicate-extensions-lucene-from-lucene-query,`Query`-based predicates>>.
* Overhead for application threads: reindexing is done directly in application threads,
and it may require additional time to load data that must be indexed from the database.
Depending on the amount of data to load,
this may increase the application's latency and/or decrease its throughput.
* No horizontal scalability: there can only be one application node,
and all indexes need to live on the same server.

[[architecture-examples-no-coordination-elasticsearch]]
=== [[architecture-examples-elasticsearch]] Single-node or multi-node application, without coordination and with the Elasticsearch backend

[[architecture-examples-no-coordination-elasticsearch-description]]
==== Description

With the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>>, indexes are not tied to the application node.
They are managed by a separate cluster of Elasticsearch nodes,
and accessed through calls to REST APIs.

Thus, it is possible to set up multiple application nodes in such a way
that they all perform index updates and search queries independently,
without coordinating with each other.

image::architecture-no-coordination-elasticsearch.png[Simple architecture with Elasticsearch backend,align="center"]

TIP: The Elasticsearch cluster may be a single node living on the same server as the application.

[[architecture-examples-no-coordination-elasticsearch-pros-and-cons]]
==== Pros and cons

Pros:

* Easy to extend: you can easily access most Elasticsearch features,
even those that are not exposed by Hibernate Search, by providing your own JSON.
See for example <<search-dsl-predicate-extensions-elasticsearch-from-json,JSON-defined predicates>>,
or <<search-dsl-aggregation-extensions-elasticsearch-from-json,JSON-defined aggregations>>,
or <<search-dsl-query-elasticsearch-json,leveraging advanced features with JSON manipulation>>.
* Horizontal scalability of the indexes: you can size the Elasticsearch cluster according to your needs.
See link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/scalability.html["Scalability and resilience" in the Elasticsearch documentation].
* Horizontal scalability of the application: you can have as many instances of the application as you need
(though high concurrency increases the likeliness of some problems with this architecture, see "Cons" below).

Cons:

* <<limitations-backend-indexing-error>>.
* <<limitations-parallel-embedded-update>>.
* Need to manage an additional service: the Elasticsearch cluster.
* Overhead for application threads: reindexing is done directly in application threads,
and it may require additional time to load data that must be indexed from the database.
Depending on the amount of data to load,
this may increase the application's latency and/or decrease its throughput.
* <<backend-elasticsearch-io-refresh,Delayed visibility>> (~1 second) of index updates (near-real-time).
While changes can be made visible as soon as possible after the database changes,
Elasticsearch is link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/getting-started-concepts.html#_near_realtime_nrt[near-real-time] by nature,
and won't perform very well if you need changes to be visible immediately after the database changes.

[[architecture-examples-outbox-polling-elasticsearch]]
=== [[_elasticsearch]] Multi-node application with outbox polling and Elasticsearch backend

include::components/incubating-warning.asciidoc[]

[[architecture-examples-outbox-polling-elasticsearch-description]]
==== [[architecture-examples-database-polling-elasticsearch-description]] Description

With Hibernate Search's <<coordination-outbox-polling,`outbox-polling` coordination strategy>>,
entity change events are not processed immediately in the ORM session where they arise,
but are pushed to an outbox table in the database.

A background process polls that outbox table for new events,
and processes them asynchronously,
updating the indexes as necessary.
Since that queue <<coordination-outbox-polling-sharding,can be sharded>>,
multiple application nodes can share the workload of indexing.

This requires the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>>
so that indexes are not tied to a single application node
and can be updated or queried from multiple application nodes.

image::architecture-outbox-polling-elasticsearch.png[Clustered architecture with outbox polling and Elasticsearch backend,align="center"]

[[architecture-examples-outbox-polling-elasticsearch-pros-and-cons]]
==== [[architecture-examples-database-polling-elasticsearch-pros-and-cons]] Pros and cons

Pros:

* Safest:
** the possibility of out-of-sync indexes caused by <<limitations-backend-indexing-error,indexing errors in the backend>>
that affects other architectures is eliminated here,
because entity change events <<coordination-outbox-polling-indexing-guarantee,are persisted in the same transaction as the entity changes>>
allowing retries for as long as necessary.
** the possibility of out-of-sync indexes caused by <<limitations-parallel-embedded-update,concurrent updates>>
that affects other architectures is eliminated here,
because <<coordination-outbox-polling-indexing-full-loading,each entity instance is reloaded from the database within a new transaction>>
before being re-indexed.
* Easy to extend: you can easily access most Elasticsearch features,
even those that are not exposed by Hibernate Search, by providing your own JSON.
See for example <<search-dsl-predicate-extensions-elasticsearch-from-json,JSON-defined predicates>>,
or <<search-dsl-aggregation-extensions-elasticsearch-from-json,JSON-defined aggregations>>,
or <<search-dsl-query-elasticsearch-json,leveraging advanced features with JSON manipulation>>.
* Minimal overhead for application threads:
application threads <<coordination-outbox-polling-indexing-background,only need to append events to the queue>>,
they don't perform reindexing themselves.
* Horizontal scalability of the indexes: you can size the Elasticsearch cluster according to your needs.
See link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/scalability.html["Scalability and resilience" in the Elasticsearch documentation].
* Horizontal scalability of the application: you can have as many instances of the application as you need.

Cons:

* Need to manage an additional service: the Elasticsearch cluster.
* Delayed visibility (~1 second or more, depending on load and hardware) of index updates.
First because Elasticsearch is link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/getting-started-concepts.html#_near_realtime_nrt[near-real-time] by nature,
but also because <<coordination-outbox-polling-indexing-visibility,the event queue introduces additional delays>>.
* Impact on the database schema: <<coordination-outbox-polling-schema,additional tables must be created in the database>>
to hold the data necessary for coordination.
* Overhead for the database: the background process that reads entity changes and performs reindexing
<<coordination-outbox-polling-indexing-full-loading,needs to read changed entities from the database>>.

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>> (no Hibernate ORM)::
This architecture cannot be implemented with the Standalone POJO Mapper at the moment,
because this mapper <<mapper-pojo-standalone-coordination,does not support coordination>>.

Also, configure coordination as explained in <<coordination-outbox-polling>>.
