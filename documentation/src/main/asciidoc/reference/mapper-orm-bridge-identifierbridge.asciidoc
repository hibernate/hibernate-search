= Identifier bridges

== Basics

An identifier bridge is a pluggable component that implements
the mapping of an entity property to a document identifier.
It is applied to a property with the `@DocumentId` annotation
or with a <<mapper-orm-custom-annotations,custom annotation>>.

Implementing an identifier bridge boils down to implementing two methods:

* one method to convert the property value (any type) to the document identifier (a string);
* one method to convert the document identifier back to the original property value.

Below is an example of a custom identifier bridge that converts
a custom `BookId` type to its string representation and back:

<1> The bridge must implement the `IdentifierBridge` interface.
One generic parameters must be provided:
the type of property values (values in the entity model).
<2> The `toDocumentIdentifier` method takes the property value and a context object as parameters,
and is expected to return the corresponding document identifier.
It is called when indexing,
but also when parameters to the search DSL
<<search-dsl-argument-type,must be transformed>>,
in particular for the <<search-dsl-predicate-id,ID predicate>>.
<3> The `fromDocumentIdentifier` methods takes the document identifier and a context object as parameters,
and is expected to return the original property value.
It is called when mapping search hits to the corresponding entity.

== Type resolution

By default, the identifier bridge's property type is determined automatically,
using reflection to extract the generic type argument of the `IdentifierBridge` interface.

For example, in `public class MyBridge implements IdentifierBridge<BookId>`,
the property type is resolved to `BookId`:
the bridge will be applied to properties of type `BookId`.

The fact that the type is resolved automatically using reflection brings a few limitations.
In particular, it means the generic type argument cannot be just anything;
as a general rule, you should stick to literal types (`MyBridge implements IdentifierBridge<BookId>`)
and avoid generic type parameters and wildcards
(`MyBridge<T extends Number> implements IdentifierBridge<T>`,
`MyBridge implements IdentifierBridge<List<? extends Number>>).

If you need more complex types,
you can bypass the automatic resolution and specify types explicitly
using an <<mapper-orm-bridge-identifierbridge-identifierbinder,`IdentifierBinder`>>.

== Compatibility across indexes with `isCompatibleWith()`

An identifier bridge is involved in indexing,
but also in the search DSLs,
to convert values passed to the <<search-dsl-predicate-id,`id` predicate>>
to a document identifier that the backend will understand.

When creating an `id` predicate targeting multiple entity types (and their indexes),
Hibernate Search will have multiple bridges to choose from: one per entity type.
Since only one predicate with a single value can be created,
Hibernate Search needs to pick a single bridge.

By default, when a custom bridge is assigned to the field,
Hibernate Search will throw an exception because it cannot decide which bridge to pick.

If the bridges assigned to the field in all indexes produce the same result,
it is possible to indicate to Hibernate Search that any bridge will do
by implementing `isCompatibleWith`.

This method accepts another bridge in parameter,
and returns `true` if that bridge can be expected to always behave the same as `this`.

== Configuring the bridge more finely with `IdentifierBinder`

To configure a bridge more finely,
it is possible to implement a value binder that will be executed at bootstrap.
This binder will be able in particular to inspect the type of the property.

.Implementing an `IdentifierBinder`

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/bridge/identifierbridge/binder/BookIdBinder.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The binder must implement the `IdentifierBinder` interface.
<2> Implement the `bind` method.
<3> Call `context.bridge(...)` to define the identifier bridge to use.
<4> Pass the expected type of property values.
<5> Pass the identifier bridge instance.
<6> The identifier bridge must still be implemented.
Here the bridge class is nested in the binder class,
because it is more convenient,
but you are obviously free to implement it in a separate java file.

<1> Map the property to the document identifier.
<2> Instruct Hibernate Search to use our custom identifier binder.
Note the use of `identifierBinder` instead of `identifierBridge`.
It is also possible to reference the binder by its name, in the case of a CDI/Spring bean.
====

== Passing parameters

The identifier bridges are usually applied with the built-in <<mapper-orm-identifiermapping-basics,`@DocumentId` annotation>>.
which does not accept any parameter other than the identifier bridge/binder.

In some cases, it is necessary to pass parameters directly to the identifier bridge or identifier binder.
This is achieved by defining a <<mapper-orm-custom-annotations,custom annotation>> with attributes:

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/bridge/identifierbridge/parameter/OffsetIdentifierBridge.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Implement a bridge that index the identifier as is,
but adds a configurable offset,
For example, with an offset of 1 and database identifiers starting at 0, index identifiers will start at 1.
<2> The bridge accepts one parameter in its constructors:
the offset to apply to identifiers.

[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/bridge/identifierbridge/parameter/OffsetDocumentId.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Define an annotation with retention `RUNTIME`.
*Any other retention policy will cause the annotation to be ignored by Hibernate Search*.
<2> Since we're defining an identifier bridge, allow the annotation
to target either methods (getters) or fields.
<3> Mark this annotation as a property mapping,
and instruct Hibernate Search to apply the given processor whenever it finds this annotation.
It is also possible to reference the processor by its name, in the case of a CDI/Spring bean.
<4> Optionally, mark the annotation as documented,
so that it is included in the javadoc of your entities.
<5> Define custom attributes to configure the value bridge.
Here we define an offset that the bridge should add to entity identifiers.
<6> The processor must implement the `PropertyMappingAnnotationProcessor` interface,
setting its generic type argument to the type of the corresponding annotation.
Here the processor class is nested in the annotation class,
because it is more convenient,
but you are obviously free to implement it in a separate Java file.
<7> In the `process` method, instantiate the bridge
and pass the annotation attribute as constructor argument.
<8> Declare that this property is to be used to generate the document identifier.
<9> Instruct Hibernate Search to use our bridge to convert between the property and the document identifiers.
Alternatively, we could pass an identifier binder instead,
using the `identifierBinder()` method.

== Accessing the ORM session or session factory from the bridge

Contexts passed to the bridge methods can be used to retrieve the Hibernate ORM session or session factory.

<2> Retrieve the `SessionFactory` from the extended context.
The `Session` is not available here.
<3> Apply an extension to the context to access content specific to Hibernate ORM.
<4> Retrieve the `Session` from the extended context.
====

== Injecting beans into the bridge or binder

With <<configuration-bean-frameworks,compatible frameworks>>,
Hibernate Search supports injection of beans into both the `IdentifierBridge` and the `IdentifierBinder`.

NOTE: This only applies to beans instantiated by Hibernate Search itself.
As a rule of thumb, if you need to call `new MyBridge()` at some point,
the bridge won't get auto-magically injected.

The context passed to the identifier binder's `bind` method
also exposes a `getBeanResolver` method to access the bean resolver and instantiate beans explicitly.

See <<configuration-bean-injection>> for more details.

== Incubating features

include::components/incubating-warning.asciidoc[]

The context passed to the identifier binder's `bind` method
exposes a `bridgedElement()` method that gives access to metadata about the value being bound,
in particular its type.

See the javadoc for more information.
