If you are upgrading an existing application from an earlier version of Hibernate Search to the latest release,
make sure to check out the http://hibernate.org/search/documentation/migrate/[migration guide].

[WARNING]
====
**To Hibernate Search 5 users**

If you pull our artifacts from a Maven repository, and you come from Hibernate Search 5,
be aware that just bumping the version number will not be enough.

In particular, the group IDs changed from `org.hibernate` to `org.hibernate.search`,
most of the artifact IDs changed to reflect the new mapper/backend design,
and the Lucene integration now requires an explicit dependency instead of being available by default.
Read <<mapper-orm-getting-started-dependencies>> for more information.

Additionally, be aware that a lot of APIs have changed, some only because of a package change,
others because of more fundamental changes
(like moving away from using Lucene types in Hibernate Search APIs).
For that reason, you are encouraged to migrate first to Hibernate Search 6.0
using the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/migration/html_single/[6.0 migration guide],
and only then to later versions (which will be significantly easier).
