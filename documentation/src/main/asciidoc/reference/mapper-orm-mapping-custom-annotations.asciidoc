== Basics

By default, Hibernate Search only recognizes built-in mapping annotations
such as `@Indexed`, `@GenericField` or `@IndexedEmbedded`.

To use custom annotations in a Hibernate Search mapping,
two steps are required:

. Implementing a processor for that annotation:
`TypeMappingAnnotationProcessor` for type annotations,
`PropertyMappingAnnotationProcessor` for method/field annotations,
or `ConstructorMappingAnnotationProcessor` for constructor annotations.
. Annotating the custom annotation with either `@TypeMapping`, `@PropertyMapping` or `@ConstructorMapping`,
passing as an argument the reference to the annotation processor.

Once this is done, Hibernate Search will be able to detect custom annotations in **indexed classes**
(though not necessarily in custom projection types, see <<mapper-orm-custom-annotations-root>>).
Whenever a custom annotation is encountered,
Hibernate Search will instantiate the annotation processor
and call its `process` method, passing the following as arguments:

* A `mapping` parameter allowing to define the mapping for the type or property
using the <<mapper-orm-programmatic-mapping,programmatic mapping API>>.
* An `annotation` parameter representing the annotation instance.
* A `context` object with various helpers.

Custom annotations are most frequently used to apply custom, parameterized bridges.
You can find examples in these sections in particular:

* <<mapper-orm-bridge-valuebridge-parameters,Passing parameters to a value bridge>>
* <<mapper-orm-bridge-propertybridge-parameters,Passing parameters to a property bridge>>
* <<mapper-orm-bridge-typebridge-parameters,Passing parameters to a type bridge>>

[TIP]
====
It is completely possible to use custom annotations for parameter-less bridges,
or even for more complex features such as indexed-embedded:
every feature available in the <<mapper-orm-programmatic-mapping,programmatic mapping API>>
can be triggered by a custom annotation.

== Custom root mapping annotations

To have Hibernate Search consider a custom annotation as a <<mapper-orm-mapping-configuration-scanning-basics,root mapping annotation>>,
add the `@RootMapping` meta-annotation to the custom annotation.

This will ensure Hibernate Search processes annotations on types annotated with the custom annotation
even if those types are not referenced in the index mapping,
which is mainly useful for custom annotations related to <<mapper-orm-mapping-projection,projection mapping>>.
