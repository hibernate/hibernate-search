////
TODO explain the general concepts around querying the index in the Hibernate Search / ORM integration.
It's not as obvious as it seems: we're querying the index, but getting the results from the database...
See the Search 5 docs, it's probably explained in detail there.
Also point to the various other sections (sort, projection, ...) where relevant.
