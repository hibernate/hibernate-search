This section is currently incomplete.
A decent introduction is included in the getting started guide: see <<getting-started-analysis>>.

TODO The getting started section has a link pointing here and expects the section to
include a detailed explanation of analysis, how it works and how to configure it in HSearch.
////

To know which character filters, tokenizers and token filters are available,
refer to the documentation specific to each backend:

* For Lucene, either browse the Lucene JavaDoc or read the corresponding section on the
link:http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalyzersTokenizersTokenFilters[Solr Wiki].
* For Elasticsearch, have a look at the online documentation.
If you want to use a built-in analyzer and not create your own:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html[analyzers];
if you want to define your own analyzer:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-charfilters.html[character filters],
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html[tokenizers],
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenfilters.html[token filters].

[NOTE]
====
Why the reference to the Apache Solr wiki for Lucene?

The analyzer factory framework was originally created in the Apache Solr project.
Most of these implementations have been moved to Apache Lucene, but the
documentation for these additional analyzers can still be found in the Solr Wiki. You might find
other documentation referring to the "Solr Analyzer Framework"; just remember you don't need to
depend on Apache Solr anymore: the required classes are part of the core Lucene distribution.
