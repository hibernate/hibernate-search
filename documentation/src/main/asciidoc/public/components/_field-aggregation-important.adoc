In order to use aggregations based on the value of a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapping-directfieldmapping-aggregable,aggregable>> in the mapping.

This is not possible for full-text fields, in particular;
see <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-fulltextfield,here>> for an explanation and some solutions.
