====
Features detailed below are _incubating_: they are still under active development.

The usual https://hibernate.org/community/compatibility-policy/[compatibility policy] does not apply:
the contract of incubating elements (e.g. types, methods, configuration properties, etc.)
may be altered in a backward-incompatible way -- or even removed -- in subsequent releases.

You are encouraged to use incubating features so the development team can get feedback and improve them,
but you should be prepared to update code which relies on them as needed.
