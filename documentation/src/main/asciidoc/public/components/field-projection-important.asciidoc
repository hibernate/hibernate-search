[IMPORTANT]
====
In order to use projections based on the value of a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapping-directfieldmapping-projectable,projectable>> in the mapping.

This is optional with the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>>,
where all fields are projectable by default.
