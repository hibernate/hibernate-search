====
`@SearchEntity` and its corresponding programmatic mapping `.searchEntity()`
are unnecessary for Hibernate ORM entities,
and in fact unsupported when using the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>.

See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-5076[HSEARCH-5076]
to track progress on allowing the use of `@SearchEntity` in the Hibernate ORM integration
to map non-ORM entities.
