====
Direct changes to the HTTP request may conflict with Hibernate Search features
and be supported differently by different versions of Elasticsearch.

Similarly, the content of the HTTP response may change
depending on the version of Elasticsearch,
depending on which Hibernate Search features are used,
and even depending on how Hibernate Search features are implemented.

Thus, features relying on direct access to HTTP requests or responses
cannot be guaranteed to continue to work when upgrading Hibernate Search,
even for micro upgrades (`x.y.z` to `x.y.(z+1)`).

Use this at your own risk.
