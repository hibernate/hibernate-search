====
Coordination is a complex topic,
and the problems it solves may appear unclear at first sight.
You may find it easier to approach coordination from a higher level.

For a few example architectures involving different coordination strategies
and a summary of the differences between each architecture,
see <<architecture-examples>>.

For a summary of the differences between coordination strategies
specifically in the context of listener-triggered indexing,
see <<listener-triggered-indexing-concepts>>.
