= Getting started with Hibernate Search's Standalone POJO Mapper

:numbered:

include::../../components/_incubating-warning.adoc[]

This guide will walk you through the initial steps required
to index and query your entities using http://hibernate.org/search/[Hibernate Search],
when your entities are **not** defined in http://hibernate.org/orm/[Hibernate ORM].

// Note as relfile -prefix/-suffix are just prepended/appended to the string created based on the file location we reference to
// in some cases we need to get rid of some of the leading/trailing `..` in those strings. That is when we use `just-to-be-removed`.
// E.g. href="../../../getting-started/just-to-be-removed/../orm/index/../en-US/html_single/......"
// here the `..` before `/orm/index` need to be consumed by something -- by `just-to-be-removed`.
ifdef::backend-pdf[:relfileprefix: {hibernateSearchDocUrl}../../../getting-started/just-to-be-removed/]

If your entities **are** defined in Hibernate ORM, see xref:../orm/index.adoc#mapper-orm-getting-started[this other guide] instead.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-assumptions]]
== Assumptions

This getting-started guide aims to be generic and does not tie itself to any framework in particular.
If you use link:{springBootUrl}[Spring Boot] or link:{quarkusUrl}[Quarkus],
make sure to first have a look at xref:{reference-documentation-location}#compatibility-framework[framework support] for tips and to learn about quirks.

For the sake of simplicity, this guide assumes you are building an application deployed as a single instance on a single node.
For more advanced setups, you are encouraged to have a look at the xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture-examples[Examples of architectures].

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-dependencies]]
== Dependencies

The Hibernate Search artifacts can be found in Maven's http://central.sonatype.org/[Central Repository].
If you get Hibernate Search from Maven, it is recommended to import Hibernate Search BOM
as part of your dependency management to keep all its artifact versions aligned:

[source, XML, subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Import Hibernate Search BOM to get all of its artifact versions aligned: -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-search-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Any other dependency management entries -->
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

If you do not want to, or cannot, fetch the JARs from a Maven repository,
you can get them from the
link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/{hibernateSearchVersion}/[distribution bundle hosted at Sourceforge].

In order to use Hibernate Search, you will need at least two direct dependencies:

* a dependency to the xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture-hsearch-components-mapper["mapper"],
which extracts data from your domain model and maps it to indexable documents;
* and a dependency to the xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture-hsearch-components-backend["backend"],
which allows indexing and searching these documents.

Below are the most common setups and matching dependencies for a quick start;
read xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture[Architecture] for more information.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-configuration]]
== Configuration

Once you have added all required dependencies to your application,
it's time to have a look at the configuration.

The configuration properties of Hibernate Search with the xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapper-pojo-standalone[Standalone POJO Mapper]
are set programmatically when building the mapping.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-mapping]]
== Mapping

Let's assume that your application contains the entity classes `Book` and `Author`
and you want to index them in order to search for books.

.Book and Author entities BEFORE adding Hibernate Search specific annotations
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/gettingstarted/withouthsearch/Book.java[tags=include;!getters-setters]
----
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/gettingstarted/withouthsearch/Author.java[tags=include;!getters-setters]
----
====

To make these entities searchable, you will need to map them to an index structure.
The mapping can be defined using xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping-annotations[annotations],
or using a xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping-programmatic[programmatic API];
this getting started guide will show you a simple annotation mapping.
For more details, refer to xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping[Mapping entities to indexes].

Below is an example of how the model above can be mapped.

.Book and Author entities AFTER adding Hibernate Search specific annotations
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/gettingstarted/withhsearch/defaultanalysis/Book.java[tags=include;!getters-setters]
----
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/gettingstarted/withhsearch/defaultanalysis/Author.java[tags=include;!getters-setters]
----
<1> `@Indexed` marks `Book` as indexed, i.e. an index will be created for that entity, and that index will be kept up to date.
<2> `@DocumentId` marks the property used to generate a document identifier.
<3> `@FullTextField` maps a property to a full-text index field with the same name and type.
Full-text fields are broken down into tokens and normalized (lowercased, ...).
Here we're relying on default analysis configuration,
but most applications need to customize it;
this will be addressed <<mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-analysis,further down>>.
<4> `@KeywordField` maps a property to a non-analyzed index field.
Useful for identifiers, for example.
<5> Hibernate Search is not just for full-text search: you can index non-`String` types with the `@GenericField` annotation,
A xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping-directfieldmapping-supported-types[broad range of property types] are supported out-of-the-box,
such as primitive types (`int`, `double`, ...) and their boxed counterpart (`Integer`, `Double`, ...),
enums, date/time types, `BigInteger`/`BigDecimal`, etc.
<6> `@IndexedEmbedded` "embeds" the indexed form of associated objects (entities or embeddables)
into the indexed form of the embedding entity.
+
Here, the `Author` class defines a single indexed field, `name`.
Thus adding `@IndexedEmbedded` to the `authors` property of `Book`
will add a single field named `authors.name` to the `Book` index.
This field will be populated automatically based on the content of the `authors` property,
and the books will be re-indexed whenever Hibernate Search xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture-hsearch-indexing[detects that the `name` property of their author changes].
See xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping-indexedembedded[Mapping associated elements with `@IndexedEmbedded`] for more information.
<7> Entities that are only `@IndexedEmbedded` in other entities,
but do not require to be searchable by themselves, do not need to be annotated with `@Indexed`.
<8> Most of the time, you will need to put `@DocumentId` on contained, non-indexed entity types such as `Author`,
to allow Hibernate Search to retrieve the identifier from entities of that type.
<9> `Book` embeds data from the `Author` entity, so `Book` needs to be reindexed when `Author` changes,
and thus Hibernate Search needs to be able to retrieve the books of a particular author when the author changes.
For that reason, we need to provide information to Hibernate Search about the inverse side of associations.
====

This is a very simple example, but is enough to get started.
Just remember that Hibernate Search allows more complex mappings:

* Multiple `@*Field` annotations exist, some of them allowing full-text search,
some of them allowing finer-grained configuration for field of a certain type.
You can find out more about `@*Field` annotations in xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping-directfieldmapping[Mapping a property to an index field with `@GenericField`, `@FullTextField`, ...].
* Properties, or even types, can be mapped with finer-grained control using "bridges".
This allows the mapping of types that are not supported out-of-the-box.
See xref:{reference-documentation-location}#binding[Binding and bridges] for more information.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-initialization]]
== Initialization

Before the application is started for the first time,
some initialization may be required:

* The indexes and their schema need to be created.
* Data already present in another datastore (if any) needs to be indexed.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-initialization-schema-management]]
=== Schema management

Before indexing can take place, indexes and their schema need to be created,
either on disk (Lucene) or through REST API calls (Elasticsearch).

Fortunately, by default, Hibernate Search will take care of creating indexes on the first startup:
you don't have to do anything.

The next time the application is started, existing indexes will be re-used.

[NOTE]
====
Any change to your mapping (adding new fields, changing the type of existing fields, ...)
between two restarts of the application
will require an update to the index schema.

This will require some special handling, though it can easily be solved by dropping and re-creating the index.
See xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapping-changes[Changing the mapping of an existing application] for more information.
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-initialization-indexing]]
=== Initial indexing

As we'll see <<mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-indexing,later>>, Hibernate Search makes it possible to explicitly index an entity
every time it changes in the application.

However, if you use Hibernate Search to index data from another datastore,
this datastore may already contain data when you add the Hibernate Search integration.
That data is unknown to Hibernate Search, and thus has to be indexed through a batch process.

// Note as relfile -prefix/-suffix are just prepended/appended to the string created based on the file location we reference to
// in some cases we need to get rid of some of the leading/trailing `..` in those strings. That is when we use `just-to-be-removed`.
// E.g. href="../../../just-to-be-removed/../getting-started/orm/index/../en-US/html_single/......"
// here the `..` before `/getting-started/orm` need to be consumed by something -- by `just-to-be-removed`.
//
// Here we need to reset the prefix to point to the getting started guide,
// and right after we set it back to point to the reference doc
ifdef::backend-pdf[:relfileprefix: {hibernateSearchDocUrl}../../../getting-started/just-to-be-removed/]

This is possible thanks to the mass indexer API,
but a little more involved than
with the xref:../orm/index.adoc#mapper-orm-getting-started-initialization-indexing[Hibernate ORM mapper],
because a way to load entities from the other datastore needs to be plugged in.

// we reset the prefix to point to the doc url as all following xrefs will point to the reference doc:
ifdef::backend-pdf[:relfileprefix: {hibernateSearchDocUrl}../]

Due to this (relative) complexity, we won't cover it in this guide,
but if you want to know more,
have a look at xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-massindexer[Mass indexing].

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-indexing]]
== Indexing

Indexing is performed explicitly through an `SearchIndexingPlan`, accessible from a `SearchSession`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, in particular when using the Elasticsearch backend,
changes will not be visible right after the session is closed.
A slight delay (by default one second) will be necessary for Elasticsearch to process the changes.

For that reason, if you modify entities in a session,
and then execute a search query right after that session is closed,
the search results may not be consistent with the changes you just performed.

See xref:{reference-documentation-location}#indexing-automatic-synchronization[Synchronization with the indexes] for more information about this behavior and how to tune it.
====

Use `add` when the entity is first added and you are absolutely certain it does not exist in the index yet:

----
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-searching]]
== Searching

Once the data is indexed, you can perform search queries.

The following code will prepare a search query targeting the index for the `Book` entity,
filtering the results so that at least one field among `title` and `authors.name`
contains the string `refactoring`.
The matches are implicitly on words ("tokens") instead of the full string,
and are case-insensitive: that's because the targeted fields are *full-text* fields
with the <<mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-analysis-default-analyzer,default analyzer>> being applied.

.Using Hibernate Search to query the indexes
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/gettingstarted/withhsearch/defaultanalysis/GettingStartedDefaultAnalysisIT.java[tags=searching-lambdas]
----
<1> Create a Hibernate Search session, called `SearchSession`.
<2> Initiate a search query on the index mapped to the `Book` entity.
<3> Define that we will only retrieve entity identifiers.
Retrieving entities directly is possible, but requires xref:{reference-documentation-location}#mapper-pojo-standalone-search-query-loading[more configuration],
so we won't discuss it in this guide.
<4> Define that only documents matching the given predicate should be returned.
The predicate is created using a factory `f` passed as an argument to the lambda expression.
<5> Build the query and fetch the results, limiting to the top 20 hits.
<6> Retrieve the total number of matching entities.
<7> Retrieve the identifiers of matching entities.
<8> In case you're not interested in the whole result, but only in the hits,
you can also call `fetchHits()` directly.
====

If for some reason you don't want to use lambdas, you can use an alternative, object-based syntax,
but it will be a bit more verbose:

<8> Retrieve the identifiers of matching entities.
<9> In case you're not interested in the whole result, but only in the hits,

It is possible to get just the total hit count, using `fetchTotalHitCount()`.

While the examples above retrieved hits as entity identifiers,
it is just one of the possible hit types.
See xref:{reference-documentation-location}#search-dsl-projection[Projection DSL] for more information.
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-analysis]]
== Analysis

Full-text search allows fast matches on words in a case-insensitive way,
which is one step further than substring search in a relational database.
But it can get much better: what if we want a search with the term "refactored"
to match our book whose title contains "refactoring"?
That's possible with custom analysis.

Analysis defines how both the indexed text and search terms are supposed to be processed.
This involves _analyzers_,
which are made up of three types of components, applied one after the other:

* zero or (rarely) more character filters, to clean up the input text:
`A <strong>GREAT</strong> résume` => `A GREAT résume`.
* a tokenizer, to split the input text into words, called "tokens":
`A GREAT résume` => `[A, GREAT, résume]`.
* zero or more token filters, to normalize the tokens and remove meaningless tokens.
`[A, GREAT, résume]` => `[great, resume]`.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-getting-started-analysis-default-analyzer]]
There are built-in analyzers,
in particular the default one, which will:

* tokenize (split) the input according to the Word Break rules
of the http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/[Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm];
* filter (normalize) tokens by turning uppercase letters to lowercase.

The default analyzer is a good fit for most language, but is not very advanced.
To get the most out of analysis, you will need to define a custom analyzer
by picking the tokenizer and filters most suited to your specific needs.

The following paragraphs will explain how to configure and use
a simple yet reasonably useful analyzer.
For more information about analysis and how to configure it,
refer to the xref:{reference-documentation-location}#concepts-analysis[Analysis] section.

Each custom analyzer needs to be given a name in Hibernate Search.
This is done through analysis configurers, which are defined per backend:

. First, you need to implement an analysis configurer, a Java class that implements a backend-specific interface:
`LuceneAnalysisConfigurer` or `ElasticsearchAnalysisConfigurer`.
. Second, you need to alter the configuration of your backend to actually use your analysis configurer.

As an example, let's assume that one of your indexed `Book` entities has the title
"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code",
and you want to get hits for any of the following search terms:
"Refactor", "refactors", "refactored" and "refactoring".
One way to achieve this is to use an analyzer with the following components:

* A "standard" tokenizer, which splits words at whitespaces, punctuation characters and hyphens.
It is a good general-purpose tokenizer.
* A "lowercase" filter, which converts every character to lowercase.
* A "snowball" filter, which applies language-specific https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming[stemming].
* Finally, an "ascii-folding" filter, which replaces characters with diacritics ("é", "à", ...)
with their ASCII equivalent ("e", "a", ...).

The examples below show how to define an analyzer with these components, depending on the backend you picked.

== What's next

The above paragraphs gave you an overview of Hibernate Search.

The next step after this tutorial is to get more familiar
with the overall architecture of Hibernate Search (xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture[Architecture])
and review the xref:{reference-documentation-location}#architecture-examples[Examples of architectures] to pick the most appropriate for your use case.
