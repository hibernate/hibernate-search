[[schema-management-basics]]
== [[mapper-orm-schema-management-basics]] Basics

Before indexes can be used for indexing or searching, they must be created on disk (Lucene) or in the remote cluster (Elasticsearch).
With Elasticsearch in particular, this creation may not be obvious since it requires to describe the schema for each index,
which includes in particular:

* the definition of every analyzer or normalizer used in this index;
* the definition of every single field used in this index,
including in particular its type, the analyzer assigned to it, whether it requires doc values, etc.

Hibernate Search has all the necessary information to generate this schema automatically,
so it is possible to delegate the task of managing the schema to Hibernate Search.

[[schema-management-strategy]]
== [[mapper-orm-schema-management-strategy]] Automatic schema management on startup/shutdown

The property `hibernate.search.schema_management.strategy` can be set to one of the following values
in order to define what to do with the indexes and their schema on startup and shutdown.

[cols="1a,2a,1a",options="header"]
|====
|Strategy|Definition|Warnings
|[[mapper-orm-schema-management-strategy-none]]`none`
|A strategy that does not do anything on startup or shutdown.

Indexes and their schema will not be created nor deleted on startup or shutdown.
Hibernate Search will **not even check** that the index actually exists.
|With Elasticsearch, indexes and their schema will have to be created explicitly before startup.
|[[mapper-orm-schema-management-strategy-validate]]`validate`
|A strategy that does not change indexes nor their schema,
but checks that indexes exist and validates their schema on startup.

An exception will be thrown on startup if:

[[schema-management-manager]]
== [[mapper-orm-schema-management-manager]] Manual schema management

Schema management does not have to happen automatically on startup and shutdown.

Using the `SearchSchemaManager` interface,
it is possible to trigger schema management operations explicitly
after Hibernate Search has started.

[TIP]
====
The most common use case is to set the <<schema-management-strategy,automatic schema management strategy>> to `none`
and handle the creation/deletion of indexes manually when some other conditions are met,
for example the Elasticsearch cluster has finished booting.

After schema management operations are complete,
you will often want to populate indexes.
To that end, use the <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexer>>.
====

The `SearchSchemaManager` interface exposes the following methods.

[cols="1a,2a,1a",options="header"]

(which is not possible at all on AWS).

With the Lucene backend, schema update is a no-op,
because <<schema-management-concepts-lucene-schema,local Lucene indexes don't have a schema>>.
(it just creates missing indexes).
|[[mapper-orm-schema-management-manager-drop-if-existing]]`dropIfExisting()`
|Drops existing indexes.
|<<schema-management-concepts-drop-loses-data,All indexed data will be lost>>.

Below is an example using a `SearchSchemaManager` to drop and create indexes,
then using a <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexer>> to re-populate the indexes.
The
<<indexing-massindexer-parameters-drop-and-create-schema,`dropAndCreateSchemaOnStart` setting of the mass indexer>>
would be an alternative solution to achieve the same results.

[[schema-management-concepts]]
== [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts]] How schema management works

[[schema-management-concepts-massindexing]]
 [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts-massindexing]]Creating/updating a schema does not create/update indexed data::
Creating or updating indexes and their schema through schema management
will not populate the indexes:

* newly created indexes will always be empty.
* indexes with a recently updated schema will still contain the same indexed data,
i.e. new fields won't be added to documents just because they were added to the schema.

This is by design: reindexing is a potentially long-running task that should be triggered explicitly.
To populate indexes with pre-existing data from the database,
use <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexing>>.

[[schema-management-concepts-drop-loses-data]]
 [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts-drop-loses-data]]Dropping the schema means losing indexed data::

Dropping a schema will drop the whole index, including all indexed data.
+
A dropped index will need to be re-created through schema management,
then populated with pre-existing data from the database through <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexing>>.
[[schema-management-concepts-lucene-schema]]
 [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts-lucene-schema]]Schema validation and update are not effective with Lucene::
The Lucene backend will only validate that the index actually exists and create missing indexes,
because there is no concept of schema in Lucene
beyond the existence of index segments.
[[schema-management-concepts-validation-permissive]]
 [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts-validation-permissive]]Schema validation is permissive::
With Elasticsearch, schema validation is as permissive as possible:

* Fields that are unknown to Hibernate Search will be ignored.
* Settings that are more powerful than required will be deemed valid.
For example, a field that is not marked as sortable in Hibernate Search
but marked as `"docvalues": true` in Elasticsearch will be deemed valid.
* Analyzer/normalizer definitions that are unknown to Hibernate Search will be ignored.

+
One exception: date formats must match exactly the formats specified by Hibernate Search,
due to implementation constraints.
[[schema-management-concepts-update-failure]]
 [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts-update-failure]]Schema updates may fail::
A schema update, triggered by the `create-or-update` strategy, may simply fail.
This is because schemas may change in an incompatible way, such as a field having its type changed,
or its analyzer changed, etc.
+
Worse, since updates are handled on a per-index basis,
a schema update may succeed for one index but fail on another,
leaving your schema as a whole half-updated.
+
For these reasons, **using schema updates in a production environment is not recommended**.
Whenever the schema changes, you should either:

* drop and create indexes, then <<indexing-massindexer,reindex>>.
* OR update the schema manually through custom scripts.

+
In this case, the `create-or-update` strategy will prevent Hibernate Search from starting,
but it may already have successfully updated the schema for another index, making a rollback difficult.
[[schema-management-concepts-index-closing]]
 [[mapper-orm-schema-management-concepts-index-closing]]Schema updates on Elasticsearch may close indexes::
Elasticsearch does not allow updating analyzer/normalizer definitions on an open index.
Thus, when analyzer or normalizer definitions have to be updated during a schema update,
Hibernate Search will temporarily stop the affected indexes.
+
For this reason, the `create-or-update` strategy should be used with caution
when multiple clients use Elasticsearch indexes managed by Hibernate Search:
those clients should be synchronized in such a way that while Hibernate Search is starting,
no other client needs to access the index.
+
Also, since Elasticsearch on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/aes-supported-es-operations.html[does not support the `_close`/`_open` operations],
**the schema update will fail** when trying to update analyzer definitions
on an AWS Elasticsearch cluster.
The only workaround is to avoid the schema update on AWS.
It should be avoided in production environments regardless:
see <<schema-management-concepts-update-failure>>.


[[schema-management-export]]
== Exporting the schema

[[schema-management-export-filesystem]]
=== Exporting the schema to a set of files

The <<mapper-orm-schema-management-manager,schema manager>> provides a way to export schemas to the filesystem.
The output is backend-specific.

[NOTE]
====
Schema exports are constructed based on the mapping information and configurations (e.g. such as the backend version).
Resulting exports are not compared to or validated against the actual backend schema.
====

For Elasticsearch, the files provide the necessary information to create indexes (along with their settings and mapping).
The file tree structure of an export is shown below:
[source]
----
# For the default backend the index schema will be written to:
.../backend/indexes/<index-name>/create-index.json
.../backend/indexes/<index-name>/create-index-query-params.json
# For additional named backends:
.../backends/<name of a particular backend>/indexes/<index-name>/create-index.json
.../backends/<name of a particular backend>/indexes/<index-name>/create-index-query-params.json

[[schema-management-export-custom]]
=== Exporting to a custom collector

<<mapper-orm-schema-management-manager,Search schema managers>> allow walking through the schema exports based on the data such managers contains.
To do so a `SearchSchemaCollector` must be implemented and passed to the schema manager's `exportExpectedSchema(..)` method.

[[schema-management-export-offline]]
=== Exporting in offline mode

Sometimes it can be useful to export the schema offline,
from an environment that doesn't have access to e.g. the Elasticsearch cluster.

See <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration-version,this section>> for more information on how to achieve offline startup.
