= Main API Entry Points

This section details the main entry points to Hibernate Search APIs at runtime,
i.e. APIs to index, search, look up metadata, ...

[[entrypoints-search-mapping]]
== `SearchMapping`

[[entrypoints-search-mapping-basics]]
=== Basics

The `SearchMapping` is the top-most entrypoint to Hibernate Search APIs:
it represents the whole mapping from entities to indexes.

The `SearchMapping` is thread-safe: it can safely be used concurrently from multiple threads.
However, that does not mean the objects it returns (`SearchWorkspace`, ...) are themselves thread-safe.

[TIP]
====
The `SearchMapping` in Hibernate Search is the equivalent of
the `EntityManagerFactory`/`SessionFactory` in JPA/Hibernate ORM.
====

[TIP]
====
Some frameworks, such as link:{quarkusUrl}[Quarkus],
allow you to simply https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-search-orm-elasticsearch#multiple-persistence-units-attaching-cdi[`@Inject` the `SearchMapping`]
into your CDI beans.

[[entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-orm]]
=== Retrieving the `SearchMapping` with the Hibernate ORM integration

With the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>,
the `SearchMapping` is <<mapper-orm-startup,created automatically when Hibernate ORM starts>>.

To retrieve the `SearchMapping`,
call `Search.mapping(...)` and pass the `EntityManagerFactory`/`SessionFactory`:

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/entrypoints/HibernateOrmEntryPointsIT.java[tags=searchMapping-fromSessionFactory]
----
<1> Retrieve the `SessionFactory`.
Details depend on <<compatibility-framework,your framework>>, but this is generally achieved by injecting it into your own class,
e.g. by annotating a field of that type with `@Inject` or `@PersistenceUnit`.
<2> Call `Search.mapping(...)`, passing the `SessionFactory` as an argument.
This will return the `SearchMapping`.
====

Still with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>, the same can be done from a JPA `EntityManagerFactory`:

[[entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-pojo-standalone]]
=== Retrieving the `SearchMapping` with the Standalone POJO Mapper

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
the `SearchMapping` is the result of starting Hibernate Search.

See <<mapper-pojo-standalone-startup,this section>> for more information
about starting Hibernate Search with the Standalone POJO Mapper.

[[entrypoints-search-session]]
== `SearchSession`

[[entrypoints-search-session-basics]]
=== Basics

The `SearchSession` represents the context in which a sequence of related operations are executed.
It should generally be used for a very short time, for example to process a single web request.

The `SearchSession` is **not** thread-safe: it must not be used concurrently from multiple threads.

[TIP]
====
The `SearchSession` in Hibernate Search is the equivalent of
the `EntityManager`/`Session` in JPA/Hibernate ORM.

into your CDI beans.

[[entrypoints-search-session-mapper-orm]]
=== Retrieving the `SearchSession` with the Hibernate ORM integration

To retrieve the `SearchSession` with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>,
call `Search.session(...)` and pass the `EntityManager`/`Session`:

e.g. by annotating a field of that type with `@Inject` or `@PersistenceContext`.
<2> Call `Search.session(...)`, passing the `Session` as an argument.
This will return the `SearchSession`.
====

Still with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>, the same can be done from a JPA `EntityManager`:

.Retrieving the `SearchSession` from a JPA `EntityManager`
====

====

[[entrypoints-search-session-mapper-pojo-standalone]]
=== Retrieving the `SearchSession` with the Standalone POJO Mapper

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
the `SearchSession` should be created and closed explicitly:

.Creating the `SearchSession`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/entrypoints/StandalonePojoEntryPointsIT.java[tags=searchSession-simple]
----
<1> <<entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-pojo-standalone,Retrieve the `SearchMapping`>>.
<2> Create a new session.
Note we're using a try-with-resources block,
so that the session will automatically be closed when we're done with it,
which will in particular trigger the execution of the <<indexing-plan,indexing plan>>.
====

[WARNING]
====
Forgetting to close the `SearchSession` will lead to indexing not being executed,
and may even cause memory leaks.
====

The `SearchSession` can also be configured with a few options:

.Creating the `SearchSession` with options
====

----
<1> <<entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-pojo-standalone,Retrieve the `SearchMapping`>>.
<2> Start creating a new session.
Note we're using a try-with-resources block,
so that the session will automatically be closed when we're done with it,
which will in particular trigger the execution of the <<indexing-plan,indexing plan>>.
<3> Pass options to the new session.
<4> Build the new session.
====

[[entrypoints-search-scope]]
== `SearchScope`

The `SearchScope` represents a set of indexed entities and their indexes.

The `SearchScope` is thread-safe: it can safely be used concurrently from multiple threads.
However, that does not mean the objects it returns (`SearchWorkspace`, ...) are themselves thread-safe.

A `SearchScope` can be retrieved from a <<entrypoints-search-mapping,`SearchMapping`>> as well as from a <<entrypoints-search-session,`SearchSession`>>.

.Retrieving a `SearchScope` from a `SearchMapping`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/entrypoints/HibernateOrmEntryPointsIT.java[tags=searchScope-fromSearchMapping]
----
<1> <<entrypoints-search-mapping,Retrieve the `SearchMapping`>>.
<2> Create a `SearchScope` targeting the `Book` entity type only.
<3> Create a `SearchScope` targeting both the `Associate` entity type and the `Manager` entity type.
The scope's generic type parameter can be any common supertype of those entity types.
<4> A scope will always target all subtypes of the given classes, and the given classes do not need to be indexed entity types themselves.
This creates a `SearchScope` targeting all (indexed entity) subtypes of the `Person` interface;
in our case this will target both the `Associate` entity type and the `Manager` entity type.
<5> For advanced use cases,
it is possible to target entity types by their name.
For <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM>> this would be the JPA entity name,
and for the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>
this would be the name assigned to the entity type upon declaration in the <<mapper-pojo-standalone-startup,configurer>>.
In both cases, the entity name is the simple name of the Java class by default.
<6> Passing `Object.class` will create a scope targeting every single indexed entity types.
