[[mapping-entitydefinition-basics]]
== Basics

Before a type can be <<mapping-entityindexmapping,mapped to indexes>>,
Hibernate Search needs to be aware of which types
in the application domain model are <<concepts-entity,entity types>>.

When <<mapper-orm,indexing Hibernate ORM entities>>,
the entity types are fully defined by Hibernate ORM (generally through Jakarta's `@Entity` annotation),
and no explicit definition is necessary: **you can safely skip this entire section**.

When using the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
entity types need to be <<mapping-entitydefinition-explicit,defined explicitly>>.

[[mapping-entitydefinition-explicit]]
== Explicit entity definition

include::../components/_incubating-warning.adoc[]

include::../components/_search-entity-orm-warning.adoc[]

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
<<concepts-entity,entity types>> must be marked explicitly with the `@SearchEntity` annotation.

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/entitydefinition/Book.java[tags=search-entity-default]
----
<1> Annotate the type with `@SearchEntity`
<2> `@Indexed` is optional: it is only necessary if you intend to <<mapping-entityindexmapping,map this type to an index>>.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Not all types are entity types, even if they have a composite structure.

Incorrectly marking types as entity types may force you to add unnecessary complexity to your domain model,
such as <<mapping-identifiermapping-explicit,defining identifiers>>
or <<mapping-reindexing-associationinverseside,an inverse side for "associations" to such types>>
that won't get used.

Make sure to read <<concepts-entity,this section>> for more information on
what entity types are and why they are necessary.
====

[NOTE]
====
Subclasses do **not** inherit the `@SearchEntity` annotation.

Each subclass must be annotated with `@SearchEntity` as well,
or it will not be considered as an entity by Hibernate Search.

However, for subclasses that are also annotated with `@SearchEntity`,
some entity-related configuration can be inherited;
see the relevant sections for details.
====

By default, with the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>:

* The <<mapping-entitydefinition-name,entity name>>
will be equal to the class' simple name (`java.lang.Class#getSimpleName`).
* The entity will not be configured for loading,
be it to <<mapping-entitydefinition-loading-selection,return entities as hits in search queries>>
or for <<mapping-entitydefinition-loading-mass,mass indexing>>.

See the following sections to override these defaults.

[[mapping-entitydefinition-name]]
== Entity name

include::../components/_incubating-warning.adoc[]

The <<concepts-entity,entity>> name,
distinct from the name of the corresponding class,
is involved in various places, including but not limited to:

* as the default index name for <<mapping-entityindexmapping,`@Indexed`>>;
* for <<backend-elasticsearch-type-name,entity type name mapping in Elasticsearch>>;
* to <<search-dsl-query-targeting-entityName,target entity types using a String>>.

The entity name defaults to the class' simple name (`java.lang.Class#getSimpleName`).

[WARNING]
====
Changing the entity name of an <<mapping-entityindexmapping,indexed>> entity
may require <<indexing-massindexer,full reindexing>>,
in particular when using the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch/OpenSearch backend>>.

See <<backend-elasticsearch-type-name-discriminator,this section>> for more information.
====

With the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>,
this name may be overridden through various means,
but usually is through Jakarta Persistence's `@Entity` annotation,
i.e. with `@Entity(name = ...)`.

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
entity types are <<mapping-entitydefinition-explicit,defined with `@SearchEntity`>>,
and the entity name may be overridden with `@SearchEntity(name = ...)`.

[[mapping-entitydefinition-loading-mass]]
=== Mass loading strategy

A "mass loading strategy" gives Hibernate Search
the ability to load entities of a given type
for <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexing>>.

With the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>,
a mass loading strategy gets configured automatically for every single Hibernate ORM entity,
and no further configuration is required.

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
entity types are <<mapping-entitydefinition-explicit,defined with `@SearchEntity`>>,
and, in order to take advantage of mass indexing,
a mass loading strategy must be applied explicitly
with `@SearchEntity(loadingBinder = ...)`.

Below is an example of `MassLoadingStrategy` implementation for an imaginary datastore.

====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/loading/mass/MyMassLoadingStrategy.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The strategy must have access to the datastore to be able to open connections,
but it should not generally have any open connection.
<2> Implement an identifier loader to retrieve the identifiers of all entities that will have to be indexed.
Hibernate Search will only call this method once per mass indexing.
<3> Retrieve the <<indexing-massindexer-parameters-batchsizetoloadobjects,batch size>> configured on the `MassIndexer`.
This defines how many IDs (at most) must be returned in each `List` passed to the sink.
<4> Retrieve the list of entity types to be loaded:
Hibernate Search may request loading of multiple types from a single loader
if those types share similar mass loading strategies (see tips/warnings below).
<5> The identifier loader owns a connection exclusively: it should create one when it's created, and close it when it's closed.
Related: the identifier loader always executes in the same thread.
<6> Count the number of entities to index.
This is just an estimate: it can be off to some extent,
but that will lead to incorrect reporting in the <<indexing-massindexer-parameters-monitor,monitor>> (by default, the logs).
<7> Retrieve identifiers in successive batches, one per call to `loadNext()`, and pass them to the sink.
<8> When there are no more identifiers to load, let the sink know by calling `complete()`.
<9> Implement an entity loader to actually load entities from the identifiers retrieved above.
Hibernate Search will call this method multiple times for a single mass indexing,
to create <<indexing-massindexer-parameters-threadstoloadobjects,multiple loaders>> that execute in parallel.
<10> Each entity loader owns a connection exclusively: it should create one when it's created, and close it when it's closed.
Related: each entity loader always executes in the same thread.
<11> Load the entities corresponding to the identifiers passed in argument and pass them to the sink.
Entities passed to the sink do not need to be in the same order as the identifiers passed in argument.
====

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search will optimize loading by grouping together
types that have the same `MassLoadingStrategy`,
or different strategies that are equal according to `equals()`/`hashCode()`.

When grouping types together, only one of the strategies will be called,
and it will get passed a "type group" that includes all types that should be loaded.

This happens in particular when configuring the loading binder from a "parent" entity type
is inherited by subtypes, and sets the same strategy on subtypes.
====

[WARNING]
====
Be careful of non-abstract (instantiable) parent classes in inheritance trees:
when the "type group" passed to the `createIdentifierLoader` method
contains a parent type (say, `Animal`) and none of the subtypes (neither `Lion` nor `Zebra`),
then the loader really should only load identifiers of instances of the parent type,
not of its subtypes
(it should load identifiers of entities whose type is exactly `Animal`, not `Lion` nor `Zebra`).
====

Once all types to reindex have their mass loading strategy implemented and assigned,
they can be reindexed using the <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexer>>:

[[mapping-entitydefinition-loading-selection]]
=== Selection loading strategy

A "selection loading strategy" gives Hibernate Search
the ability to load entities of a given type
to <<search-dsl-query-generality,return entities loaded from an external source as hits in search queries>>.

With the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>,
a selection loading strategy gets configured automatically for every single Hibernate ORM entity,
and no further configuration is required.

With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
entity types are <<mapping-entitydefinition-explicit,defined with `@SearchEntity`>>,
and, in order to return entities loaded from an external source in search queries,
a selection loading strategy must be applied explicitly
with `@SearchEntity(loadingBinder = ...)`.
