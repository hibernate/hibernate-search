[[other-integrations-jakarta]]
== Jakarta EE

include::../components/_incubating-warning.adoc[]

Hibernate Search includes experimental support for link:{jakartaUrl}[Jakarta EE],
and it requires only one small change:
when declaring the dependencies of your project,
you must add `-jakarta` to some artifact identifiers.

For example, an application using Hibernate ORM and the Elasticsearch backend
will need to update its dependencies as follows:

[source, XML, subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-core-jakarta</artifactId> <!--1-->
   <version>{hibernateVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
   <artifactId></artifactId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta</artifactId> <!--2-->
   <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId> <!--3-->
   <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
<1> Replaces `hibernate-core`.
<2> Replaces `hibernate-search-mapper-orm`.
<3> No replacement necessary: this artifact does not rely on Java EE.

All artifacts relying directly or indirectly on Java EE must be replaced with their Jakarta counterpart.
This includes in particular:

* https://in.relation.to/2021/06/04/hibernate-is-jakarta-jpa-2/#get-it[Hibernate ORM artifacts]
* `hibernate-search-mapper-orm` => `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-jakarta`
* `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core` => `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core-jakarta`
* ...

Artifacts that do not rely on Java EE at all, on the other hand,
do not have a Jakarta counterpart and must not be replaced.
These artifacts should be excluded from your replacements in particular:

* `hibernate-search-engine`
* `hibernate-search-backend-lucene`
* `hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch`
* `hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch-aws`
* ...

[[other-integrations-orm6]]
== Hibernate ORM 6

include::../components/_incubating-warning.adoc[]

Hibernate Search includes experimental support for link:{hibernateOrm6DocUrl}[Hibernate ORM 6],
and it requires only one small change:
when declaring the dependencies of your project,
you must add `-orm6` to some artifact identifiers.

[WARNING]
====
The experimental support for Hibernate ORM 6 in Hibernate Search {hibernateSearchVersion}
targets Hibernate ORM version {hibernateOrm6Version}.

Newer versions of Hibernate ORM 6 may introduce breaking changes,
in which case they will no longer be compatible with
the experimental support for Hibernate ORM 6 in Hibernate Search {hibernateSearchVersion},
until Hibernate Search catches up in its next release.
====


For example, an application using Hibernate ORM 6 and the Elasticsearch backend
will need to update its dependencies as follows:

[source, XML, subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.orm</groupId> <!--1-->
   <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
   <version>{hibernateOrm6Version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-mapper-orm-orm6</artifactId> <!--2-->
   <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch</artifactId> <!--3-->
   <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
<1> Replaces `org.hibernate:hibernate-core`; notice how the groupId changed in Hibernate ORM 6.
<2> Replaces `hibernate-search-mapper-orm`.
<3> No replacement necessary: this artifact does not rely on Java EE or Hibernate ORM.

All artifacts relying directly or indirectly on Java EE or Hibernate ORM must be replaced with their ORM 6 counterpart.
This includes in particular:

* https://in.relation.to/2018/12/06/hibernate-orm-600-alpha1-out/#artifacts[Hibernate ORM artifacts]
* `hibernate-search-mapper-orm` => `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-orm6`
* `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core` => `hibernate-search-mapper-orm-batch-jsr352-core-orm6`
* ...

Artifacts that do not rely on Java EE or Hibernate ORM at all, on the other hand,
do not have an ORM 6 counterpart and must not be replaced.
These artifacts should be excluded from your replacements in particular:

* `hibernate-search-engine`
* `hibernate-search-backend-lucene`
* `hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch`
* `hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch-aws`
* ...
