== Basics

For some use cases, you only need the query to return a small subset of the data contained in your domain object.
In these cases, returning managed entities and extracting data from these entities may be overkill:
extracting the data from the index itself would avoid the database round-trip.

Projections do just that: they allow the query to return something more precise than just "the matching entities".
Projections can be configured when building the search query:

If that type is not appropriate or if the field does not exist, an exception will be thrown.
<4> Fetch the results, which will have the expected type.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use lambdas:

While `field` projections are certainly the most common,
they are not the only type of projection.
Other projections allow
<<search-dsl-projection-composite,composing custom beans containing extracted data>>,
getting references to the <<search-dsl-projection-documentReference,extracted documents>>
or the <<search-dsl-projection-reference,corresponding entities>>,
or getting information related to the search query itself
(<<search-dsl-projection-score,score>>, ...).

== Projecting to a custom (annotated) type

For more complex projections, it is possible to <<mapping-projection,define a custom (annotated) record or class>>
and have Hibernate Search infer the corresponding projections from the custom type's constructor parameters.

<1> Annotate the record type with `@ProjectionConstructor`,
either at the type level (if there's only one constructor)
or at the constructor level (if there are <<mapping-projection-multiple-constructors,multiple constructors>>).
<2> To project on the entity identifier, annotate the relevant constructor parameter with <<search-dsl-projection-id-mapping,`@IdProjection`>>.
+
Most projections have a corresponding annotation that can be used on constructor parameters.
<3> To project on a value field, add a constructor parameter named after that field and with the same type as that field.
See <<mapping-projection-inner-inference>> for more information on how constructor parameters should be defined.

Alternatively, the field projection can be configured explicitly with <<search-dsl-projection-field-mapping,`@FieldProjection`>>.
<4> To project on an object field, add a constructor parameter named after that field and with its own custom projection type.
Multivalued projections <<mapping-projection-inner-inference-type,must be modeled as a `List<...>`>> or supertype.
+
Alternatively, the object projection can be configured explicitly with <<search-dsl-projection-object-mapping,`@ObjectProjection`>>.
<5> Annotate any custom projection type used for object fields with `@ProjectionConstructor` as well.

[[search-dsl-projection-entity]]
== `entity`: return matched entities

The `entity` projection returns the entity corresponding to the document that matched.

How the entity is loaded exactly depends on your mapper and configuration:

* With the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>, returned objects are managed entities loaded by Hibernate ORM from the database.
You can use them as you would use any entity returned from traditional Hibernate ORM queries.
* With the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>,
entities are loaded from an external datastore if <<mapping-entitydefinition-loading-selection,configured>>,
or (failing that) are projected from the index if the entity type declares a <<mapping-projection,projection constructor>>.
If neither loading configuration nor projection constructor are found,
the `entity` projection will simply fail.

NOTE: If an entity cannot be loaded from the external datastore/database
(e.g. it was deleted there, and the index wasn't updated yet),
the hit will be omitted and won't appear in the returned `List` at all.
The total hit count, however, will not take this omission into account.

[[search-dsl-projection-entity-requested-type]]
=== Requesting a specific entity type

In some (rare) cases, the code creating the projection
may have to work with a `SearchProjectionFactory<?, ?>`,
i.e. a factory that carries no information regarding the type of loaded entities.

In those cases, it's possible to request a specific type of entities:
Hibernate Search will check when the projection is created that
the requested type matches the type of loaded entities.

<<mapping-directfieldmapping-supported-types,the corresponding field may be of type `String`>>;
the values returned by the `field` projection will be of the enum type regardless.

This should generally be what you want,
but if you ever need to bypass conversion and have unconverted values returned to you instead
(of type `String` in the example above),

[[search-dsl-projection-field-mapping]]
=== `@FieldProjection` in projections to custom types

To achieve a `field` projection inside a <<search-dsl-projection-mapped,projection to an annotated custom type>>,
you can rely on the default <<mapping-projection-inner-inference,inferred projection>>:
when no annotations are present on a constructor parameter,
it will be inferred to a field projection to the field with the same name as the constructor parameter
(or an <<search-dsl-projection-object,object projection>>,
see <<mapping-projection-inner-inference-type,here for details>>).

To force a field projection,
or to customize the field projection further (for example to set the field path explicitly),
use the `@FieldProjection` annotation on the constructor parameter:

[[search-dsl-projection-composite]]
== `composite`: combine projections

[[search-dsl-projection-composite-basics]]
=== Basics

The `composite` projection applies multiple projections and combines their results,
either as a `List<?>` or as a single object generated using a custom transformer.

To preserve type-safety, you can provide a custom transformer.
The transformer can be a `Function`, a `BiFunction`,
or a `org.hibernate.search.util.common.function.TriFunction`,
depending on the number of inner projections.
It will receive values returned by inner projections and return an object combining these values.

The constructor of `MyPair` will be called for each matched document,
with the value of the `title` field as its first argument,
and the value of the `genre` field as its second argument.
<5> Each hit will be an instance of `MyPair`.
Thus, the list of hits will be an instance of `List<MyPair>`.

If you pass more than 3 projections as arguments to `from(...)`,
then the transform function will have to take a `List<?>` as an argument,

== `object`: return one value per object in an object field

The `object` projection yields one projected value for each object in a given object field,
the value being generated by applying multiple inner projections and combining their results
either as a `List<?>` or as a single object generated using a custom transformer.

[NOTE]
====
The `object` projection may seem very similar to the <<search-dsl-projection-composite,`composite` projection>>,
and its definition via the Search DSL certainly is indeed similar.

However, there are two key differences:

1. The `object` projection will yield `null` when projecting on a single-valued object field
   if the object was null when indexing.
2. The `object` projection will yield multiple values when projecting on a multivalued object field
   if there were multiple objects when indexing.
====

[WARNING]
====
With the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>>, the object projection has a few limitations:

1. It is only available for single-valued object fields regardless of their <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure,structure>>,
or multi-valued object fields with a
<<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-nested,`NESTED` structure>>.
2. It will never yield `null` objects for multi-valued object fields.
The Lucene backend does not index `null` objects,
and thus cannot find them when searching.

These limitations do not apply to the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>>.
====

[[search-dsl-projection-object-syntax]]
=== Syntax

To preserve type-safety, you can provide a custom transformer.
The transformer can be a `Function`, a `BiFunction`,
or a `org.hibernate.search.util.common.function.TriFunction`,
depending on the number of inner projections.
It will receive values returned by inner projections and return an object combining these values.

[[search-dsl-projection-object-mapping-filters]]
=== `@ObjectProjection` filters to exclude nested projections and break `@ObjectProjection` cycles

By default, <<search-dsl-projection-object-mapping,`@ObjectProjection`>>
and <<mapping-projection-inner-inference,inferred object projections>> will include
every projection encountered in the projection constructor of the projected type, recursively.

This will work just fine for simpler use cases, but may lead to problems for more complex models:

* If the projection constructor of the projected type declares many nested projections,
only some of which are actually useful to the "surrounding" type,
the extra projections will decrease search performance needlessly.
* If there is a cycle of `@ObjectProjection`
(e.g. `A` includes a nested object projection `b` of type `B`, which includes a nested projection `a` of type `A`)
the root projection type will end up with an infinite amount of fields
(`a.b.someField`, `a.b.a.b.someField`, `a.b.a.b.a.b.someField`, ...),
which Hibernate Search will detect and reject with an exception.

To address these problems, it is possible to apply filters
to only include those nested projections that are actually useful.
Projections on excluded fields, at runtime, will have their value set to `null`,
or an empty list for multivalued projections.

Available filtering attributes on `@ObjectProjection` are:

`includePaths`::
The paths of nested index field to be included,
i.e. for which the corresponding nested projections will actually be retrieved from the index.
+
Provided paths must be relative to the projected object field,
i.e. they must not include its <<search-dsl-projection-object-mapping-path,path>>.
+
This takes precedence over `includeDepth` (see below).
+
Cannot be used in combination with `excludePaths` in the same `@ObjectProjection`.
`excludePaths`::
The paths of index fields from the indexed-embedded element that must *not* be embedded.
+
Provided paths must be relative to the projected object field,
i.e. they must not include its <<search-dsl-projection-object-mapping-path,path>>.
+
This takes precedence over `includeDepth` (see below).
+
Cannot be used in combination with `includePaths` in the same `@ObjectProjection`.
`includeDepth`::
The number of levels of indexed-embedded that will have all their fields included by default.
+
`includeDepth` is the number of levels of object projections that
will have all their nested field/object projections
included by default and actually be retrieved from the index.
+
Up to and including that depth, object projections
will be included along with their nested (non-object) field projections,
even if these fields are not included explicitly through `includePaths`,
unless these fields are excluded explicitly through `excludePaths`:
+
* `includeDepth=0` means fields of this object projection are *not* included,
nor is any field of nested indexed-embedded elements,
unless these fields are included explicitly through `includePaths`.
* `includeDepth=1` means fields of this object projection *are* included,
unless these fields are excluded explicitly through `excludePaths`,
but *not* fields of nested object projections (`@ObjectProjection` within this `@ObjectProjection`),
unless these fields are included explicitly through `includePaths`.
* `includeDepth=2` means fields of this object projection
and fields of immediately nested object projections (`@ObjectProjection` within this `@ObjectProjection`) *are* included,
unless these fields are explicitly excluded through `excludePaths`,
but *not* fields of nested object projections beyond that
(`@ObjectProjection` within an `@ObjectProjection` within this `@ObjectProjection`),
unless these fields are included explicitly through `includePaths`.
* And so on.

+
The default value depends on the value of the `includePaths` attribute:

* if `includePaths` is empty, `includeDepth` defaults to infinity (include all fields at every level).
* if `includePaths` is *not* empty, `includeDepth` defaults to `0`
(only include fields included explicitly).

[NOTE]
.Mixing `includePaths` and `excludePaths` at different nesting levels
====
In general, it is possible to use `includePaths` and `excludePaths` at different levels of nested `@ObjectProjection`.
When doing so, keep in mind that the filter at each level can only reference reachable paths,
i.e. a filter cannot reference a path that was excluded by a nested `@ObjectProjection` (implicitly or explicitly).
====

Below are three examples: one leveraging `includePaths` only,
one leveraging `excludePaths`, and one leveraging `includePaths` and `includeDepth`.

All three examples are based on the following mapped entity
that rely on <<mapping-indexedembedded,@IndexedEmbedded>>
and the <<mapping-indexedembedded-filtering,very similar filters>> it provides:

The following fields in particular are excluded:

and *not* explicitly included either because `includePaths` on `parents` does not include `parents.parents.nickname`.
* `parents.parents.parents.parents.name`: *not* implicitly included at depth `3` because `includeDepth = 2`
(so `parents.parents.parents` is included implicitly,
but `parents.parents.parents.parents` and subfields can only be included explicitly)
and *not* explicitly included either because `includePaths` on `parents` does not include `parents.parents.parents.name`.

[[search-dsl-projection-constant]]
== `constant`: return a provided constant

The `constant` projection returns the same value for every single document,
the value being provided when defining the projection.

This is only useful in some edge cases where one wants to include some broader context in the representation of every single hit.
In this case, the `constant` value will most likely be used together with
a <<search-dsl-projection-composite,`composite` projection>>
or an <<search-dsl-projection-object,`object` projection>>.

You can <<binding-projection-parameters-custom-annotation,create your own annotation>> if you need one,
backed by a <<binding-projection,custom projection binder>>.

[[search-dsl-projection-highlight]]
== `highlight`: return highlighted field values from matched documents

The `highlight` projection returns fragments from full-text fields of matched documents that caused a query match.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In order to use highlight projections of a given field,
you need to provide the list of <<mapping-directfieldmapping-highlightable,highlighters supported by the field>> in the mapping.

The <<mapping-directfieldmapping-highlightable,highlightable>> default may already enable the support of highlighting
in some cases. For more details see <<mapping-directfieldmapping-highlightable-default, how the `DEFAULT` highlightable value behaves>>.

[[search-dsl-projection-highlight-syntax]]

The `highlight` projection always returns a list of string values per highlighted field, no matter if the field is
a single or a multivalued one:

At the moment, highlighting a field within a <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-nested,nested object>> is https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-4841[not supported] and attempting to do so will lead to an exception.
Highlighting a field within a <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-flattened,flattened object>> will work correctly.

=== `@HighlightProjection` in projections to custom types

To achieve a `highlight` projection inside a <<search-dsl-projection-mapped,projection to an annotated custom type>>,
use the `@HighlightProjection` annotation on the constructor parameter:

<4> You can of course also declare other parameters with different projections;
in this example an <<mapping-projection-inner-inference,inferred projection>> to the `title` field.

<1> Pass the custom projection type to `.select(...)`.
<2> Each hit will be an instance of the custom projection type,
populated with the requested highlights and field.
====

The annotation exposes the following attributes:

`path`::
The path to the highlighted field.
+
If not set, it is inferred from the constructor parameter name.
+
[WARNING]
====
Field path inference will <<mapping-projection-inner-inference-fieldpath,fail if constructor parameter names are not included in the Java bytecode>>.
====
`highlighter`::
The name of a highlighter configured in the query;
useful to <<search-dsl-projection-highlight-options,apply different options>> to each highlight projection.
+
If not set, the projection will use the default highlighter as configured in the query.

For <<mapping-projection-programmatic,programmatic mapping>>, use `HighlightProjectionBinder.create()`.

[[search-dsl-projection-highlight-limitations]]
=== Highlight limitations

For now, Hibernate Search has limitations on where <<search-dsl-projection-highlight,highlight projections>> can be included,
and trying to apply highlight projections in these scenarios will lead to an exception being thrown, in particular:

These limitations should be addressed by link:{hibernateSearchJiraUrl}/HSEARCH-4841[HSEARCH-4841].

[[search-dsl-projection-extensions]]
== Backend-specific extensions

By calling `.extension(...)` while building a query,
it is possible to access backend-specific projections.

[NOTE]
====
As their name suggests, backend-specific projections are not portable from one backend technology to the other.

[[search-dsl-projection-extensions-lucene-document]]
=== Lucene: `document`

The `.document()` projection returns the matched document as a native Lucene `Document`.

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/projection/LuceneProjectionDslIT.java[tags=lucene-document]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The returned document is similar to the one that was indexed.

For example, if a value was transformed by the `toIndexedValue` method
of a <<binding-valuebridge,value bridge>> upon indexing,
this transformed value (after encoding) will be the value included in the document:
Hibernate Search will not convert it back using `ValueBridge#fromIndexedValue`.

However, there are some differences between the returned document and the one that was indexed:

* Only stored fields are present.
* Even stored fields may not have the same `FieldType` as they originally had.
* The document structure flattened,
i.e. even fields from <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-nested,nested documents>>
are all added to same returned document.
* <<binding-index-field-dsl-dynamic,Dynamic fields>> may be missing.

If you want a projection that retrieves the value as it was in your entity upon indexing,
use a <<search-dsl-projection-field,`field` projection>>.
