[[mapping-indexedembedded-basics]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-basics]] Basics

Using only `@Indexed` combined with `@*Field` annotations allows indexing an entity and its direct properties,
which is nice but simplistic.
A real-world model will include multiple object types holding references to one another,
like the `authors` association in the example below.

<1> The `Book` entity is indexed.
<2> The `title` of the book is mapped to an index field.
<3> But how to index the `Author` name into the `Book` index?
====

When searching for a book, users will likely need to search by author name.
In the world of high-performance indexes, cross-index joins are costly and usually not an option.
The best way to address such use cases is generally to copy data:
when indexing a `Book`, just copy the name of all its authors into the `Book` document.

That's what `@IndexedEmbedded` does:
it instructs Hibernate Search to _embed_ the fields of an associated object into the main object.
In the example below, it will instruct Hibernate Search to embed the `name` field
defined in `Author` into `Book`, creating the field `authors.name`.

[NOTE]
====
`@IndexedEmbedded` can be used on Hibernate ORM's `@Embedded` properties
as well as associations (`@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`, ...).

<2> Map `Author.name` to an index field, even though `Author` is not directly mapped to an index (no `@Indexed`).
====

[NOTE]
====
<<mapping-identifiermapping,Document identifiers>> are not index fields.
Consequently, they will be ignored by `@IndexedEmbedded`.

To embed another entity's identifier with `@IndexedEmbedded`,
map that identifier to a field explicitly using `@GenericField` or another `@*Field` annotation.
====

[WARNING]
====
When `@IndexedEmbedded` is applied to an association,
i.e. to a property that refers to entities (like the example above),
*the association must be bidirectional*.
Otherwise, Hibernate Search will throw an exception on startup.

See <<mapping-indexedembedded-reindexing>> for the reasons behind this restriction
and ways to circumvent it.
====

Index-embedding can be nested on multiple levels;
for example you can decide to index-embed the place of birth of authors,
to be able to search for books written by Russian authors exclusively:

[WARNING]
====
By default, `@IndexedEmbedded` will nest other `@IndexedEmbedded`
encountered in the indexed-embedded type recursively,
without any sort of limit, which can cause infinite recursion.

To address this, see <<mapping-indexedembedded-filtering>>.
====

[[mapping-indexedembedded-null]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-null]] [[_indexing_null_embeddeds]] `@IndexedEmbedded` and `null` values

When properties targeted by an `@IndexedEmbedded` contain `null` elements,
these elements are simply not indexed.

On contrary to <<mapping-directfieldmapping>>,
there is no `indexNullAs` feature to index a specific value for `null` objects,
but you can take advantage of the <<search-dsl-predicate-exists,`exists`>> predicate
in search queries to look for documents where a given `@IndexedEmbedded`
has or doesn't have a value:
simply pass the name of the object field to the `exists` predicate,
for example `authors` in the example above.

[[mapping-indexedembedded-multivalued]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-multivalued]] `@IndexedEmbedded` on container types

When properties targeted by an `@IndexedEmbedded` have a container type
(`List`, `Optional`, `Map`, ...),
the innermost elements will be embedded.
For example for a property of type `List<MyEntity>`, elements of type `MyEntity` will be embedded.

This default behavior and ways to override it are described
in the section <<mapping-containerextractor>>.

[[mapping-indexedembedded-name]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-name]] Setting the object field name with `name`

By default, `@IndexedEmbedded` will create an object field with the same name as the annotated property,
and will add embedded fields to that object field.
So if `@IndexedEmbedded` is applied to a property named `authors` in a `Book` entity,
the index field `name` of the authors will be copied to the index field `authors.name` when `Book` is indexed.

It is possible to change the name of the object field by setting the `name` attribute;
for example using `@IndexedEmbedded(name = "allAuthors")` in the example above will result
in the name of authors being copied to the index field `allAuthors.name`
instead of `authors.name`.

[NOTE]
====
The name must not contain the dot character (`.`).
====

[[mapping-indexedembedded-prefix]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-prefix]] Setting the field name prefix with `prefix`

[WARNING]
====
The `prefix` attribute in `@IndexedEmbedded` is deprecated and will ultimately be removed.
Use <<mapping-indexedembedded-name,`name`>> instead.
====

By default, `@IndexedEmbedded` will prepend the name of embedded fields
with the name of the property it is applied to followed by a dot.
So if `@IndexedEmbedded` is applied to a property named `authors` in a `Book` entity,
the `name` field of the authors will be copied to the `authors.name` field when `Book` is indexed.

It is possible to change this prefix by setting the `prefix` attribute,
for example `@IndexedEmbedded(prefix = "author.")` (do not forget the trailing dot!).

[CAUTION]
====
The prefix should generally be a sequence of non-dots ending with a single dot, for example `my_Property.`.

Changing the prefix to a string that does not include any dot at the end (`my_Property`),
or that includes a dot anywhere but at the very end (`my.Property.`),
will lead to complex, undocumented, legacy behavior.
Do this at your own risk.

In particular, a prefix that does not end with a dot will lead to incorrect behavior
in <<binding-index-field-dsl,some APIs exposed to custom bridges>>:
the `addValue`/`addObject` methods that accept a field name.
====

[[mapping-indexedembedded-targetType]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-targetType]] Casting the target of `@IndexedEmbedded` with `targetType`

By default, the type of indexed-embedded values is detected automatically using reflection,
taking into account <<mapping-containerextractor,container extraction>> if relevant;
for example `@IndexedEmbedded List<MyEntity>` will be detected as having values of type `MyEntity`.
Fields to be embedded will be inferred from the mapping of the value type and its supertypes;
in the example, `@GenericField` annotations present on `MyEntity` and its superclasses will be taken into account,
but annotations defined in its subclasses will be ignored.

If for some reason a schema does not expose the correct type for a property
(e.g. a raw `List`, or `List<MyEntityInterface>` instead of `List<MyEntityImpl>`)
it is possible to define the expected type of values
by setting the `targetType` attribute in `@IndexedEmbedded`.
On bootstrap, Hibernate Search will then resolve fields to be embedded based on the given target type,
and at runtime it will cast values to the given target type.

[WARNING]
====
Failures to cast indexed-embedded values to the designated type will be propagated
and lead to indexing failure.
====

[[mapping-indexedembedded-reindexing]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-reindexing]] [[_associated_objects_building_a_dependency_graph_with_containedin]] Reindexing when embedded elements change

When the "embedded" entity changes,
Hibernate Search will handle reindexing of the "embedding" entity.

This will work transparently most of the time,
as long as the association `@IndexedEmbedded` is applied to is bidirectional
(uses Hibernate ORM's `mappedBy`).

When Hibernate Search is unable to handle an association,
it will throw an exception on bootstrap.
If this happens, refer to <<mapping-reindexing-basics>> to know more.

[[mapping-indexedembedded-filtering]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-filtering]] [[search-mapping-associated-viapaths]] Filtering embedded fields and breaking `@IndexedEmbedded` cycles

By default, `@IndexedEmbedded` will "embed" everything:
every field encountered in the indexed-embedded element,
and every `@IndexedEmbedded` encountered in the indexed-embedded element,
recursively.

This will work just fine for simpler use cases, but may lead to problems for more complex models:

* If the indexed-embedded element declares many index fields (Hibernate Search fields),
only some of which are actually useful to the "index-embedding" type,
the extra fields will decrease indexing performance needlessly.
* If there is a cycle of `@IndexedEmbedded`
(e.g. `A` index-embeds `b` of type `B`, which index-embeds `a` of type `A`)
the index-embedding type will end up with an infinite amount of fields
(`a.b.someField`, `a.b.a.b.someField`, `a.b.a.b.a.b.someField`, ...),
which Hibernate Search will detect and reject with an exception.

To address these problems, it is possible to filter the fields to embed,
to only include those that are actually useful.
Available filtering attributes on `@IndexedEmbedded` are:

`includePaths`::
The paths of index fields from the indexed-embedded element that should be embedded.
+
Provided paths must be relative to the indexed-embedded element,
i.e. they must not include its <<mapping-indexedembedded-name,name>>
or <<mapping-indexedembedded-prefix,prefix>>.
+
This takes precedence over `includeDepth` (see below).
+
Cannot be used in combination with `excludePaths` in the same `@IndexedEmbedded`.
`excludePaths`::
The paths of index fields from the indexed-embedded element that must *not* be embedded.
+
Provided paths must be relative to the indexed-embedded element,
i.e. they must not include its <<mapping-indexedembedded-name,name>>
or <<mapping-indexedembedded-prefix,prefix>>.
+
This takes precedence over `includeDepth` (see below).
+
Cannot be used in combination with `includePaths` in the same `@IndexedEmbedded`.
`includeDepth`::
The number of levels of indexed-embedded that will have all their fields included by default.
+
`includeDepth` is the number of `@IndexedEmbedded` that will be traversed
and for which all fields of the indexed-embedded element will be included,
even if these fields are not included explicitly through `includePaths`,
unless these fields are excluded explicitly through `excludePaths`:
+
 * `includeDepth=0` means that fields of this indexed-embedded element are *not* included,
nor is any field of nested indexed-embedded elements,
unless these fields are included explicitly through `includePaths`.
 * `includeDepth=1` means that fields of this indexed-embedded element *are* included,
unless these fields are excluded explicitly through `excludePaths`,
but *not* fields of nested indexed-embedded elements (`@IndexedEmbedded` within this `@IndexedEmbedded`),
unless these fields are included explicitly through `includePaths`.
* `includeDepth=2` means that fields of this indexed-embedded element
and fields of the immediately nested indexed-embedded (`@IndexedEmbedded` within this `@IndexedEmbedded`) elements *are* included,
unless these fields are explicitly excluded through `excludePaths`,
but *not* fields of nested indexed-embedded elements beyond that
(`@IndexedEmbedded` within an `@IndexedEmbedded` within this `@IndexedEmbedded`),
unless these fields are included explicitly through `includePaths`.
* And so on.

+
The default value depends on the value of the `includePaths` attribute:
+
* if `includePaths` is empty, the default is `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (include all fields at every level)
* if `includePaths` is *not* empty, the default is `0`
(only include fields included explicitly).

[NOTE]
.Dynamic fields and filtering
====
<<binding-index-field-dsl-dynamic,Dynamic fields>> are not directly affected by filtering rules:
a dynamic field will be included if and only if its parent is included.

This means in particular that `includeDepth` and `includePaths`
constraints only need to match the nearest static parent of a dynamic field
in order for that field to be included.
====

[NOTE]
.Mixing `includePaths` and `excludePaths` at different nesting levels
====
In general, it is possible to use `includePaths` and `excludePaths` at different levels of nested `@IndexedEmbedded`.
When doing so, keep in mind that the filter at each level can only reference reachable paths,
i.e. a filter cannot reference a path that was excluded by a nested `@IndexedEmbedded` (implicitly or explicitly).
====

Below are three examples: one leveraging `includePaths` only,
one leveraging `excludePaths`, and one leveraging `includePaths` and `includeDepth`

[[indexedembedded-includePath]]
.Filtering indexed-embedded fields with `includePaths`

[[mapping-indexedembedded-structure]]
== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-structure]] [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-storage]] Structuring embedded elements as nested documents using `structure`

Indexed-embedded fields can be structured in one of two ways,
configured through the `structure` attribute of the `@IndexedEmbedded` annotation.
To illustrate structure options, let's assume the class `Book` is annotated with `@Indexed`
and its `authors` property is annotated with  `@IndexedEmbedded`:

* Book instance
** title = Leviathan Wakes
** authors =
*** Author instance
**** firstName = Daniel
**** lastName = Abraham
*** Author instance
**** firstName = Ty
**** lastName = Frank

[[mapping-indexedembedded-structure-flattened]]
=== [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-structure-flattened]] [[mapper-orm-indexedembedded-storage-flattened]] `DEFAULT` or `FLATTENED` structure

By default, or when using `@IndexedEmbedded(structure = FLATTENED)` as shown below,
indexed-embedded fields are "flattened",
meaning that the tree structure is not preserved.

The book instance mentioned earlier would be indexed with a structure roughly similar to this:

 * Book document
 ** title = Leviathan Wakes
 ** authors.firstName = [Daniel, Ty]
 ** authors.lastName = [Abraham, Frank]

The `authors.firstName` and `authors.lastName` fields were "flattened"
and now each has two values;
the knowledge of which last name corresponds to which first name has been lost.

This is more efficient for indexing and querying,
but can cause unexpected behavior when querying the index
on both the author's first name and the author's last name.

For example, the book instance described above
*would* show up as a match to a query such as `authors.firstname:Ty AND authors.lastname:Abraham`,
even though "Ty Abraham" is not one of this book's authors:

When indexed-embedded elements are "nested", i.e. when using `@IndexedEmbedded(structure = NESTED)` as shown below,
the tree structure is preserved by transparently creating one separate "nested" document
for each indexed-embedded element.

The book instance mentioned earlier would be indexed with a structure roughly similar to this:

 * Book document
 ** title = Leviathan Wakes
 ** Nested documents
 *** Nested document #1 for "authors"
 **** authors.firstName = Daniel
 **** authors.lastName = Abraham
 *** Nested document #2 for "authors"
 **** authors.firstName = Ty
 **** authors.lastName = Frank

The book is effectively indexed as three documents:
the root document for the book, and two internal, "nested" documents for the authors,
preserving the knowledge of which last name corresponds to which first name
at the cost of degraded performance when indexing and querying.

NOTE: The nested documents are "hidden" and won't directly show up in search results.
No need to worry about nested documents being "mixed up" with root documents.

If special care is taken when building predicates on fields within nested documents,
using a <<search-dsl-predicate-nested,`nested` predicate>>,
queries containing predicates on both the author's first name and the author's last name
will behave as one would (intuitively) expect.

For example, the book instance described above
would *not* show up as a match to a query such as `authors.firstname:Ty AND authors.lastname:Abraham`,
thanks to the `nested` predicate (which can only be used when indexing with the `NESTED` structure):

[[mapping-indexedembedded-filtering-association]]
== Filtering association elements

Sometimes, only some elements of an association should be included in an `@IndexedEmbedded`.

For example a `Book` entity might index-embed `BookEdition` instances,
but some editions might be retired and thus need to be filtered out before indexing.

Such filtering can be achieved by applying `@IndexedEmbedded` to a transient getter representing the filtered association,
and configuring reindexing with <<mapping-reindexing-associationinverseside,`@AssociationInverseSide`>>
and <<mapping-reindexing-derivedfrom,`@IndexingDependency.derivedFrom`>>.

If we wanted to, we could use <<mapping-indexedembedded-name,`@IndexedEmbedded(name = "editions")>>

<4> Hibernate ORM does not know about `editionsNotRetired`, so Hibernate Search cannot infer the inverse side of this "filtered" association.
Thus, we use `@AssociationInverseSide` to tell Hibernate Search that.
Should the label of a `BookEdition` be modified, Hibernate Search
will use this information to retrieve the corresponding `Book` to reindex.
<5> We use `@IndexingDependency.derivedFrom` to tell Hibernate Search
that whenever the status of an edition changes,
the result of `getEditionsNotRetired()` may have changed as well,
requiring reindexing.
<6> While `BookEdition#status` is not annotated, Hibernate Search will still
track its changes because of the `@IndexingDependency` annotation in `Book`.
