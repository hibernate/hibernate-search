The following list provides the Hibernate Search logging categories available in the {hibernateSearchVersion} version.
It specifies what kind of messages could be expected from a particular category and from which modules these may be produced
if a specific category of the logger is enabled.
These logging categories are shared between Hibernate Search modules to group log messages
of similar purpose coming from different parts of Hibernate Search.
