Hibernate Search's static metamodel is a set of generated classes that represents the structure of each entity's index,
thereby allowing to reference index fields in a type-safe way to create search queries through the <<search-dsl,Search DSL>>.

The basic principles are very similar to the link:{hibernateDocUrl}#tooling-modelgen[JPA static metamodel available in Hibernate ORM],
but in the case of Search the metamodel is about indexes rather than entities.
