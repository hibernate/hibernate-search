== Basics

Highlighting is a projection that returns fragments from full-text fields of matched documents that caused a query match.
Specific terms that caused the match are "highlighted" with a pair of opening and closing tags.
It can help a user to quickly identify the information they were searching for on a results page.

Highlight projections are only available for <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-fulltextfield,full-text fields>>
with an attribute configuration that allows it:

----
<1> A regular full-text field.
Such field can allow highlight projections if the <<backend-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch backend>> is used.
See the definition of the <<mapping-directfieldmapping-highlightable-default, default highlightable>> for any details.
<2> A full-text field that explicitly allows for plain and unified highlighters to be applied to it.
<3> A full-text field that explicitly allows any highlighter types to be applied to it.
See the definition of the <<mapping-directfieldmapping-highlightable-any, `ANY` highlightable>> for further details.
<4> A full-text field that implicitly allows any highlighter types to be applied to it.
Allowing projection and setting the term vector storage strategy to `WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS`
implies that any highlighter type can be used to create a highlight projection with both <<backend-lucene,Lucene>>
or <<backend-elasticsearch, Elasticsearch>> backends.
<5> A generic text field -- such field will not allow highlight projections.

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=basics]
----
<1> <<entrypoints-search-session,Retrieve the `SearchSession`>>.
<2> Start building the query as usual.
<3> Mention that the expected result of the query is the highlights on the "title" field.
An exception will be thrown if the field is not a <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-fulltextfield,full-text field>>
with <<mapping-directfieldmapping-highlightable,highlighting enabled>> or if it does not exist.
<4> The predicate from the where clause will be used to determine which documents to include in the results
and highlight the text from the "title" field.
+
Note that to get a nonempty list for a highlight projection,
the field we apply such projection to should be a part of a predicate.
If there's no match within the field we want to highlight, be it because the document was added to the results because
of some other predicate condition, or because the highlighted field wasn't a part of a predicate at all, an empty list will be returned by default.
See <<search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-no-match-size,no match size configuration>> option for more details on how this can be adjusted.
<5> Fetch the results, which will have highlighted fragments.

Note that the result of applying a highlight projection is always a list of `String`.

As an example, the result may look like:
[source, JSON]
----
[
    ["The Boscombe Valley <em>Mystery</em>"], <1>
    [
      "A Caribbean <em>Mystery</em>",
      "Miss Marple: A Caribbean <em>Mystery</em> by Agatha Christie"
    ], <2>
    ["A <em>Mystery</em> of <em>Mysteries</em>: The Death and Life of Edgar Allan Poe"] <3>
]
----
<1> First hit.
<2> Second hit with multiple highlighted snippets.
<3> Third hit.
====

Highlight projections, just like <<search-dsl-projection-field,field projections>>, can also be used in a combination with
other projection types as well as with other highlight projections:

A highlighter behavior can be configured. See various available <<search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options,configuration options>>.
A highlighter definition is provided after a where clause of a query:

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-type]]
== Highlighter type

Before a highlighter can be configured, you need to pick its type.
Picking the highlighter type is the first step in a highlighter definition:

.Specifying the plain highlighter type

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=various-highlighter-types-fvh]
----
<1> Starting the definition of a fast vector highlighter.
====

There are three options to choose from when it comes to the highlighter type:

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-type-plain]]
Plain::
The plain highlighter can be useful for simple queries targeting a single field on a small number of documents.
This highlighter uses a standard Lucene highlighter. It reads the string value of a highlighted field,
then creates a small in-memory index from it and applies query logic to perform the highlighting.
[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-type-unified]]
Unified::
The unified highlighter is used by default and does not necessarily rely on re-analyzing the text, as it can
get the offsets either from postings or from term vectors.
+
This highlighter uses a break iterator (breaks the text into sentences by default) to break the text into later scored passages.
It better supports more complex queries. Since it can work with prebuilt data, it performs better in case of a larger amount
of documents compared to the plain highlighter.
[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-type-fast-vector]]
Fast vector::
The fast vector highlighter, in addition to using a break iterator similar to the unified highlighter, it can use the boundary characters
to control the highlighted snippet.
+
This is the only highlighter that can assign different weights to highlighted fragments, allowing it to show
a fragment score differences by wrapping it with a different tag.
For more on tags, see <<search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-tags,the corresponding section>>.
+
The fast vector highlighter is also the one which can highlight entire matched phrases.
Using <<search-dsl-predicate-phrase, phrase predicates>> with other highlighter types will lead to each word in a phrase
being highlighted separately.

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-named-highlighters]]
== Named highlighters

Sometimes we might want to apply different highlighters to various fields.
We have already seen that a <<search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-confguring-default-highlighter-simple, highlighter can be configured>>.
The highlighter from that example is called the default highlighter. Search queries also allow to configure named highlighters.
A named highlighter has the same configuration capabilities as the default one.
It overrides the options set by the default highlighter if such was configured.
If a default highlighter was configured for a query then every named highlighter configured on the same query
must be of the same type as the default one. Mixing various highlighter types within the same query is only allowed when no default highlighter
was configured.

When a highlight projection has a named highlighter passed to an optional `highlighter(..)` call chained as a part of
the <<search-dsl-projection-highlight,highlight projection definition>>, then that particular highlighter will be applied
to a field projection. Named highlighters can be reused withing a query,
i.e. the same name of a named highlighter can be passed to multiple highlight projections.

.Configuring both default and named highlighters
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=basic-config]
----
<1> Add the highlight projection on a "title" field. This projection uses the default highlighter.
<2> Add the highlight projection on a "description" field and specify the name of the named highlighter.
<3> Specify the details of the default highlighter.
<4> Specify the details of the named highlighter. Note that the name matches the name passed to the configuration of the "description"
highlight projection.
<5> Fetch the results.
====

[NOTE]
====
The name of a named highlighter cannot be `null` or an empty string. An exception will be thrown if such values are used.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options]]
== [[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-tags]] Tags

By default, the highlighted text is wrapped with a pair of `<em>`/`</em>` tags. A custom pair of tags can be provided to change this behaviour.
Usually, tags are a pair of HTML tags, but they can be a pair of any character sequences.

.Setting custom tags
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=basic-tags]
----
<1> Passing a pair of open/close tags that will be used to highlight the text.
====

The fast vector highlighter, which can handle multiple tags, has a few additional methods that accept a collection of tags.

.Setting multiple custom tags
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=fvh-tags]
----
<1> Passing a collection of open tags and a single closing tag that will be used to highlight the text.
It can be helpful when configuring a tag schema that differs only in an attribute of an opening tag.
<2> Passing a pair of collections containing open/close tags that will be used to highlight the text.
====

Additionally, a fast vector highlighter has the option to enable a tag schema and set it to `HighlighterTagSchema.STYLED`
to use a predefined set of tags.

.Setting a styled tags schema
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=fvh-schema]
----
<1> Passing a styled tags schema that will be used to highlight the text.
====

Using a styled tags schema is just a shortcut to defining tags as:

.Setting tags as if the styled tags schema is used
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=fvh-schema-alternative]
----
<1> Passing the same collection of tags used when a styled schema is applied.
====

[NOTE]
====
Calling different tags configuration methods (`tag(..)`/`tags(..)`/`tagSchema(..`) or the same one multiple times
within the same highlighter definition will *not* combine them.
Tags set by the last call will be applied.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-encoder]]
== Encoder
Encoding can be applied to the highlighted snippets when highlighting the fields that store HTML. Applying an
HTML encoder to a highlighter will encode the text for inclusion into an HTML document:
it will replace HTML meta-characters such as `<` with their entity equivalent such as `&amp;lt;`;
however it will not escape the highlighting tags.
By default, a `HighlighterEncoder.DEFAULT` encoder is used, which keeps the text as is.

.Setting the HTML encoder
====

----

----
<1> Configuring the HTML encoder.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-no-match-size]]
== No match size
In case of more complex queries or when highlighting is performed for multiple fields, it might lead to a situation
where the query matched a document, but a particular highlighted field did not contribute to that match.
This will lead to an empty list of highlights for that particular document and that field.
No match size option allows you to still get some text returned even if the field didn't contribute to the document match,
and there's nothing to be highlighted in it.

The number set by this property defines the number of characters to be included starting at the beginning of a field.
Depending on the highlighter type, the amount of text returned might not precisely match the configured value since
highlighters usually try not to break the text in the middle of a word/sentence, depending on their configuration.
By default, this option is set to `0` and text will only be returned if there's something to highlight.

.Setting the no match size
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=no-match-size]
----
<1> We are looking for matches in the title.
<2> In case a word can also be found in the description, we'd want it to be highlighted.
<3> Setting the no match size to `100` to still get at least `100` first characters of a description even if the match for
a word we are searching for is not found.
====

[NOTE]
====
The unified highlighter from the <<backend-lucene,Lucene backend>> has a limited support for this option.
It cannot limit the amount of the returned text, and works more like a boolean flag to enable/disable the
feature. If a highlighter of this type has the option not set or set to `0` then no text is returned when
there was no match found. Otherwise, if the option for a highlighter of this type was set to a positive integer, all
text is returned, no matter the actual value.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-fragment-size]]
== Fragment size and number of fragments
The fragment size sets the amount of text included in each highlighted fragment, by default `100` characters.

[NOTE]
====
This is not a "hard" limit, since highlighters usually try not to break the fragment in the middle of a word. Additionally,
other features such as <<search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-boundary-scanner,boundary scanning>>
may lead to more text before and after the fragment being included as well.
====

A number of fragments configuration sets the maximum number of strings included in the resulting highlighted list.
By default, the number of fragments is limited to `5`.

A combination of these options can be helpful when highlighting large text fields.

.Setting the fragment size and the number of fragments
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=fragment-size]
----
<1> Configuring the fragment size.
<2> Configuring the maximum number of fragments to be returned.
====

[NOTE]
====
These options are supported by all highlighter types on the Elasticsearch backend.
As for the Lucene backend -- the number of fragments is also supported by all highlighter types,
while only plain and fast-vector highlighters support fragment size.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-order]]
== Order
By default, highlighted fragments are returned in the order of occurrence in the text.
By enabling the order by score option most relevant fragments will be returned at the top of the list.

.Setting the fragment size and number of fragments
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----

----
<1> A query that would boost the match of one of the searched words.
<2> Configuring the order by the score to be enabled.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-fragmenter]]
== Fragmenter
By default, the plain highlighter breaks up text into same-sized fragments but tries to avoid breaking up a phrase to be highlighted.
This is the behaviour of the `HighlighterFragmenter.SPAN` fragmenter. Alternatively, fragmenter can be set to `HighlighterFragmenter.SIMPLE`
that simply breaks up the text into same-sized fragments.

.Setting the fragmenter
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=basic-fragmenter]
----
<1> Configuring the simple fragmenter.
====

[NOTE]
====
This option is supported only by the plain highlighter.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-boundary-scanner]]
== Boundary scanner

Unified and fast vector highlighters use boundary scanners to create highlighted fragments:
they try to expand highlighted fragments by scanning text before and after those fragments for word/sentence boundaries.

An optional locale parameter can be supplied to specify how to search
for sentence and word boundaries. A sentence boundary scanner is a default option for the unified highlighter.

There are two ways to supply boundary scanner configuration to a highlighter.

.Setting the boundary scanner with DSL
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=scanner-dsl]
----
<1> Start the definition of a boundary scanner.
<2> Pick a boundary scanner type -- a word scanner in this case.
<3> Set an optional locale.
<4> End the definition of a boundary scanner.
<5> Set any other options.
====

.Setting the boundary scanner using lambda
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=scanner-lambda]
----
<1> Pass a lambda configurer to set up a boundary scanner.
<2> Set any other options
====

Alternatively, a fast vector highlighter can use a character boundary scanner which relies on two other configurations --
boundary characters and boundary max scan. When a character boundary scanner is used after a highlighted fragment is formed
with highlighted text centred, the highlighter checks for the first occurrence of any configured boundary characters to the left and right
of a currently created fragment. This lookup happens only for a maximum number of characters configured by the boundary max scan option.
If no boundary characters are found, no additional text will be included besides the already highlighted phrase
with surrounding text based on a fragment size option set for a highlighter.

The default list of boundary characters includes `.,!? \t\n`.
The default boundary max scan is equal to `20` characters.

Character boundary scanner is a default option for the fast vector highlighters.

.Setting the character boundary scanner
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/highlighting/HighlightingDslIT.java[tags=scanner-char]
----
Assuming that we have a text that contains multiple paragraphs separated with a new line (`\n`), we want to
get the entire paragraph containing the highlighted phrase. To do so, boundary characters will be set to `\n`, and
the max scan option will be based on the number of characters in paragraphs.

<1> Start the definition of a boundary scanner.
<2> Pick a boundary scanner type -- a character scanner.
<3> Set a string containing boundary characters. The overloaded methods can accept a `String` or a `Character` array.
<4> Set the max scan option.
<5> End the definition of a boundary scanner.
<6> Set any other options.
====

[NOTE]
====
This option is supported by the unified and fast vector highlighter types.
====

[[search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-phrase-limit]]
== Phrase limit
Phrase limit allows specifying the maximum number of matching phrases in a document for highlighting.
The highlighter will be going through the text and as soon as it reaches the maximum number of highlighted phrases it'll stop leaving any further occurrences as not highlighted.

[NOTE]
====
This limit is different from the <<search-dsl-highlighting-highlighter-options-fragment-size,maximum number of fragments>>:

1. Fragments are the strings returned by the highlight projections, while phrases are the sequences of highlighted (matching) terms in each fragment.
A fragment may include multiple highlighted phrases, and a given phrase may appear in multiple fragments.
2. The phrase limit is about limiting the highlighting of occurrences of matched phrases, be it multiple occurrences of the same phrase or a mix of different phrases.
For example, if we were to search for `fox` and `dog` occurrences in the sentence
`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog` and set the phrase limit to `1`, then we'll have only `fox` being highlighted
since it was the first match in the text and the phrase limit was reached.

====

By default, this phrase limit is equal to `256`.

This option can be helpful if a field contains many matches and has a lot of text overall, but we are not interested in
highlighting every occurrence.
