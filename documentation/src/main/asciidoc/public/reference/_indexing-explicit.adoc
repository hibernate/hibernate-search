While <<listener-triggered-indexing,listener-triggered indexing>> and
the <<indexing-massindexer,`MassIndexer`>>
or <<mapper-orm-indexing-jakarta-batch,the mass indexing job>>
should take care of most needs,
it is sometimes necessary to control indexing manually.

The need arises in particular when <<listener-triggered-indexing,listener-triggered indexing>> is <<mapping-annotations,disabled>>
or simply not supported (e.g. <<mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-listener-triggered,with the Standalone POJO Mapper>>),
or when listener-triggered cannot detect entity changes --
<<limitations-changes-in-session,such as JPQL/SQL `insert`, `update` or `delete` queries>>.

To address these use cases, Hibernate Search exposes several APIs
explained if the following sections.

[[listener-triggered-indexing-synchronization]]
== Configuration

As explicit indexing uses <<indexing-plan,indexing plans>> under the hood,
several configuration options affecting indexing plans will affect explicit indexing as well:

* The <<indexing-plan-synchronization,indexing plan synchronization strategy>>.
* The <<indexing-plan-filter,indexing plan filter>>.

== [[mapper-orm-indexing-manual-indexingplan-writes]] [[_deleting_instances_from_the_index]] [[_adding_instances_to_the_index]] Using a `SearchIndexingPlan` manually

Explicit access to the <<indexing-plan,indexing plan>> is done in the context of a <<entrypoints-search-session,`SearchSession`>>
using the `SearchIndexingPlan` interface.
This interface represents the (mutable) set of changes
that are planned in the context of a session,
and will be applied to indexes upon transaction commit (for the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>)
or upon closing the `SearchSession` (for the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>>).

Here is how explicit indexing based on an <<indexing-plan,indexing plan>> works at a high level:

1. When the application wants an index change,
it calls one of the `add`/`addOrUpdate`/`delete` methods on the indexing plan of the current <<entrypoints-search-session,`SearchSession`>>.
+
For the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>> the current `SearchSession` is <<entrypoints-search-session-mapper-orm,bound to the Hibernate ORM `Session`>>,
while for the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>> the `SearchSession` is <<entrypoints-search-session-mapper-pojo-standalone,is created explicitly by the application>>.
2. Eventually, the application decides changes are complete,
and the plan processes change events added so far,
either inferring which entities need to be reindexed and building the corresponding documents (<<coordination-none,no coordination>>)
or building events to be sent to the outbox (<<coordination-outbox-polling,`outbox-polling` coordination>>).
+
The application may trigger this explicitly using the indexing plan's `process` method,
but it is generally not necessary as it happens automatically:
for the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>> this happens when the Hibernate ORM `Session` gets flushed
(explicitly or as part of a transaction commit),
while for the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>> this happens when the `SearchSession` is closed.
3. Finally the plan gets executed, triggering indexing, potentially asynchronously.
+
The application may trigger this explicitly using the indexing plan's `execute` method,
but it is generally not necessary as it happens automatically:
for the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>> this happens on transaction commit,
while for the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>> this happens when the `SearchSession` is closed.

The `SearchIndexingPlan` interface offers the following methods:

`add(Object entity)`::
(Available with the <<mapper-pojo-standalone,Standalone POJO Mapper>> only.)
+
Add a document to the index if the entity type is mapped to an index (`@Indexed`).
+
WARNING: This may create duplicates in the index if the document already exists.
Prefer `addOrUpdate` unless you are really sure of yourself and need a (slight) performance boost.
`addOrUpdate(Object entity)`::
Add or update a document in the index if the entity type is mapped to an index (`@Indexed`),
and re-index documents that embed this entity (through `@IndexedEmbedded` for example).
`delete(Object entity)`::
Delete a document from the index if the entity type is mapped to an index (`@Indexed`),
and re-index documents that embed this entity (through `@IndexedEmbedded` for example).
`purge(Class<?> entityType, Object id)`::
Delete the entity from the index,
but do not try to re-index documents that embed this entity.
+
Compared to `delete`, this is mainly useful if the entity has already been deleted from the database
and is not available, even in a detached state, in the session.
In that case, reindexing associated entities will be the user's responsibility,
since Hibernate Search cannot know which entities are associated to an entity that no longer exists.
`purge(String entityName, Object id)`::
Same as `purge(Class<?> entityType, Object id)`,
but the entity type is referenced by its name (see `@javax.persistence.Entity#name`).
`process()``::
(Available with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>> only.)
+
Process change events added so far,
either inferring which entities need to be reindexed and building the corresponding documents (<<coordination-none,no coordination>>)
or building events to be sent to the outbox (<<coordination-outbox-polling,`outbox-polling` coordination>>).
+
This method is generally executed automatically (see the high-level description near top of this section),
so calling it explicitly is only useful for batching when processing a large number of items,
as explained in <<mapper-orm-indexing-manual-indexingplan-process-execute>>.
`execute()`::
(Available with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>> only.)
+
Execute the indexing plan, triggering indexing, potentially asynchronously.
+
This method is generally executed automatically (see the high-level description near top of this section),
so calling it explicitly is only useful in very rare cases,
for batching when processing a large number of items **and transactions are not an option**,
as explained in <<mapper-orm-indexing-manual-indexingplan-process-execute>>.

Below are examples of using `addOrUpdate` and `delete`.

[TIP]
====
Multiple operations can be performed in a single indexing plan.
The same entity can even be changed multiple times,
for example added and then removed:
Hibernate Search will simplify the operation as expected.

This will work fine for any reasonable number of entities,
but changing or simply loading large numbers of entities in a single session
requires special care with Hibernate ORM,
and then some extra care with Hibernate Search.
See <<mapper-orm-indexing-manual-indexingplan-process-execute>> for more information.

[[mapper-orm-indexing-manual-indexingplan-process-execute]]
== [[search-batchindex-flushtoindexes]] Hibernate ORM and the periodic "flush-clear" pattern with `SearchIndexingPlan`

include::../components/_mapper-orm-only-note.adoc[]

A fairly common use case when manipulating large datasets with JPA
is the link:{hibernateDocUrl}#batch-session-batch-insert[periodic "flush-clear" pattern],
where a loop reads or writes entities for every iteration
and flushes then clears the session every `n` iterations.
This pattern allows processing a large number of entities
while keeping the memory footprint reasonably low.

Below is an example of this pattern to persist a large number of entities
when not using Hibernate Search.

.A batch process with JPA
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/indexing/HibernateOrmManualIndexingIT.java[tags=persist-automatic-indexing-periodic-flush-clear]
----
<1> Execute a loop for a large number of elements, inside a transaction.
<2> For every iteration of the loop, instantiate a new entity and persist it.
<3> Every `BATCH_SIZE` iterations of the loop, `flush` the entity manager to send the changes to the database-side buffer.
<4> After a `flush`, `clear` the ORM session to release some memory.
====

With Hibernate Search 6 (on contrary to Hibernate Search 5 and earlier),
this pattern will work as expected:

* <<coordination-none,with coordination disabled>> (the default),
documents will be built on flushes, and sent to the index upon transaction commit.
* <<coordination-outbox-polling,with outbox-polling coordination>>,
entity change events will be persisted on flushes, and committed along with the rest of the changes upon transaction commit.

However, each `flush` call will potentially add data to an internal buffer,
which for large volumes of data may lead to an `OutOfMemoryException`,
depending on the JVM heap size,
the <<coordination,coordination strategy>>
and the complexity and number of documents.

If you run into memory issues,
the first solution is to break down the batch process
into multiple transactions, each handling a smaller number of elements:
the internal document buffer will be cleared after each transaction.

See below for an example.

[IMPORTANT]
====
With this pattern, if one transaction fails,
part of the data will already be in the database and in indexes,
with no way to roll back the changes.

However, the indexes will be consistent with the database,
and it will be possible to (manually) restart the process
from the last transaction that failed.

.A batch process with Hibernate Search using multiple transactions
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/orm/indexing/HibernateOrmManualIndexingIT.java[tags=persist-automatic-indexing-multiple-transactions]
----
<1> Add an outer loop that creates one transaction per iteration.
<2> Begin the transaction at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop.
<3> Only handle a limited number of elements per transaction.
<4> For every iteration of the loop, instantiate a new entity and persist it.
Note we're relying on listener-triggered indexing to index the entity,
but this would work just as well if listener-triggered indexing was disabled,
only requiring an extra call to index the entity.
See <<indexing-plan>>.
<5> Commit the transaction at the end of each iteration of the outer loop.
The entities will be flushed and indexed automatically.
====

[NOTE]
====
The multi-transaction solution
and the original `flush()`/`clear()` loop pattern can be combined,
breaking down the process in multiple medium-sized transactions,
and periodically calling `flush`/`clear` inside each transaction.

This combined solution is the most flexible,
hence the most suitable if you want to fine-tune your batch process.
====

If breaking down the batch process into multiple transactions is not an option,
a second solution is to just write to indexes
after the call to `session.flush()`/`session.clear()`,
without waiting for the database transaction to be committed:
the internal document buffer will be cleared after each write to indexes.

This is done by calling the `execute()` method on the indexing plan,
as shown in the example below.

[IMPORTANT]
====
With this pattern, if an exception is thrown,
part of the data will already be in the index, with no way to roll back the changes,
while the database changes will have been rolled back.
The index will thus be inconsistent with the database.

To recover from that situation, you will have to either
execute the exact same database changes that failed manually
(to get the database back in sync with the index),
or <<indexing-plan,reindex the entities>> affected by the transaction manually
(to get the index back in sync with the database).

Of course, if you can afford to take the indexes offline for a longer period of time,
a simpler solution would be to wipe the indexes clean
and <<indexing-massindexer,reindex everything>>.
