[[backend-elasticsearch-compatibility]]
== Compatibility

Hibernate Search expects an link:{elasticsearchUrl}[Elasticsearch] cluster running version {elasticsearchExpectedRunningVersions},
or an link:{openSearchUrl}[OpenSearch] cluster running version {opensearchExpectedRunningVersions}.

The version running on your cluster will be automatically detected on startup,
and Hibernate Search will adapt based on the detected version;
see <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration-version>> for details.

[TIP]
====
For information about which versions of Hibernate Search you can upgrade to,
while retaining backward compatibility with a given version of Elasticsearch/OpenSearch,
refer to the https://hibernate.org/community/compatibility-policy/#compatibility-third-party-hsearch-elasticsearch[compatibility policy].
====

The targeted version is mostly transparent to Hibernate Search users,
but there are a few differences in how Hibernate Search behaves depending
on the Elasticsearch version that may affect you.
The following table details those differences.

[[backend-elasticsearch-upgrading]]
=== [[_upgrading_elasticsearch]] Upgrading Elasticsearch

When upgrading your Elasticsearch cluster, some
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html[administrative tasks]
are still required on your cluster: Hibernate Search will not take care of those.

On top of that, there might be some fundamental differences between some versions of Elasticsearch.
Please refer to the Elasticsearch documentation and migration guides to identify any incompatible schema changes.

In such cases, the easiest way to upgrade is to delete your indexes manually,
make Hibernate Search re-create the indexes along with their schema,
and <<indexing-massindexer,reindex your data>>.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration]]
== [[elasticsearch-integration-configuration]] Basic configuration

All configuration properties of the Elasticsearch backend are optional,
but the defaults might not suit everyone.
In particular your production Elasticsearch cluster is probably not reachable at `http://localhost:9200`,
so you will need to set the address of your cluster by <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration-client,configuring the client>>.

Configuration properties are mentioned in the relevant parts of this documentation.
You can find a full reference of available properties in
<<configuration-properties-aggregated-hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch, the Elasticsearch backend configuration properties appendix>>.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-elasticsearch-cluster]]
== [[elasticsearch-integration-server-configuration]] Configuration of the Elasticsearch cluster

Most of the time, Hibernate Search does not require any specific configuration
to be applied by hand to the Elasticsearch cluster,
beyond the index mapping (schema)
which <<schema-management,can be automatically generated>>.

The only exception is <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration-sharding>>,
which needs to be enabled explicitly.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-client]]
== Client configuration

An Elasticsearch backend communicates with an Elasticsearch cluster through a REST client.
Below are the options that affect this client.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-hosts]]
=== Target hosts

The following property configures the Elasticsearch host (or hosts)
to send indexing requests and search queries to:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.hosts = localhost:9200
----
The default for this property is `localhost:9200`.

This property may be set to a String representing a host and port such as `localhost` or `es.mycompany.com:4400`,
or a String containing multiple such host-and-port strings separated by commas,
or a `Collection<String>` containing such host-and-port strings.

You may change the protocol used to communicate with the hosts using this configuration property:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.protocol = http
----
The default for this property is `http`.

This property may be set to either `http` or `https`.


Alternatively, it is possible to define both the protocol and hosts as one or more URIs using a single property:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.uris = http://localhost:9200
----

This property may be set to a String representing a URI such as `http://localhost` or `https://es.mycompany.com:4400`,
or a String containing multiple such URI strings separated by commas,
or a `Collection<String>` containing such URI strings.

[WARNING]
====
There are some constraints regarding the use of this property:

* All the uris must have the same protocol.
* Cannot be used if `hosts` or `protocol` are set.
* The provided list of URIs must not be empty.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-path-prefix]]
=== Path prefix

By default, the REST API is expected to be available to the root path (`/`).
For example a search query target all indexes will be sent to path `/_search`.
This is what you need for a standard Elasticsearch setup.

If your setup is non-standard, for example because of a non-transparent proxy
between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster,
you can use a configuration similar to this:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.path_prefix = my/path
----

With the above, a search query targeting all indexes will be sent to path `/my/path/_search` instead of `/_search`.
The path will be prefixed similarly for all requests sent to Elasticsearch.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-discovery]]
=== Node discovery

When using automatic discovery, the Elasticsearch client will periodically probe for new nodes in the cluster,
and will add those to the host list (see `hosts` in <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration-client>>).

Automatic discovery is controlled by the following properties:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.discovery.enabled = false
hibernate.search.backend.discovery.refresh_interval = 10
----

* `discovery.enabled` defines whether the feature is enabled.
Expects a boolean value. The default for this property is `false`.
* `discovery.refresh_interval` defines the interval between two executions of the automatic discovery.
Expects a positive integer, in seconds. The default for this property is `10`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-authentication-http]]
=== HTTP authentication

HTTP authentication is disabled by default,
but may be enabled by setting the following configuration properties:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.username = ironman
hibernate.search.backend.password = j@rv1s
----
The default for these properties is an empty string.

The username and password to send when connecting to the Elasticsearch servers.

[CAUTION]
====
If you use HTTP instead of HTTPS (see above),
your password will be transmitted in clear text over the network.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-aws]]
=== [[elasticsearch-integration-configuration-aws]] Authentication on Amazon Web Services

The Hibernate Search Elasticsearch backend, once configured, will work just fine in most setups.
However, if you need to use Amazon's link:{amazonOpenSearchServiceUrl}[managed OpenSearch service],
you will find it requires a proprietary authentication method:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/request-signing.html[request signing].

While request signing is not supported by default,
you can enable it with an additional dependency and a bit of configuration.

You will need to add this dependency:

[source, XML, subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.search</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-backend-elasticsearch-aws</artifactId>
   <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----

With that dependency in your classpath, you will still need to configure it.

The following configuration is mandatory:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.aws.signing.enabled = true
hibernate.search.backend.aws.region = us-east-1
----

* `aws.signing.enabled` defines whether request signing is enabled.
Expects a boolean value. Defaults to `false`.
* `aws.region` defines the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html[AWS region].
Expects a string value.
This property has no default and must be provided for the AWS authentication to work.

By default, Hibernate Search will rely on the default credentials provider from the AWS SDK.
This provider will look for credentials in various places
(Java system properties, environment variables, AWS-specific configuration, ...).
For more information about how the default credentials provider works,
see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default[its official documentation].

Optionally, you can set static credentials with the following options:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.aws.credentials.type = static
hibernate.search.backend.aws.credentials.access_key_id = AKIDEXAMPLE
hibernate.search.backend.aws.credentials.secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG+bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
----

* `aws.credentials.type` defines the type of credentials.
Set to `default` to get the default behavior (as explained above),
or to `static` to provide credentials using the properties below.
* `aws.credentials.access_key_id` defines the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html[access key ID].
Expects a string value.
This property has no default and must be provided when the credentials type is set to `static`.
* `aws.credentials.secret_access_key` defines the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html[secret access key].
Expects a string value.
This property has no default and must be provided when the credentials type is set to `static`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-connection-tuning]]
=== [[_connection_tuning]] Connection tuning

Timeouts::
+
[source]
----
# hibernate.search.backend.request_timeout = 30000
hibernate.search.backend.connection_timeout = 1000
hibernate.search.backend.read_timeout = 30000
----

* `request_timeout` defines the timeout when executing a request.
This includes the time needed to establish a connection,
send the request and read the response.
This property is not defined by default.
* `connection_timeout` defines the timeout when establishing a connection.
The default for this property is `1000`.
* `read_timeout` defines the timeout when reading a response.
The default for this property is `30000`.
+
These properties expect a positive <<configuration-property-types,Integer value>> in milliseconds, such as `3000`.

Connection pool::
+
[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.max_connections = 20
hibernate.search.backend.max_connections_per_route = 10
----

* `max_connections` defines maximum number of simultaneous connections
to the Elasticsearch cluster, all hosts taken together.
The default for this property is `20`.
* `max_connections_per_route` defines maximum number of simultaneous connections
to each host of the Elasticsearch cluster.
The default for this property is `10`.

+
These properties expect a positive <<configuration-property-types,Integer value>>, such as `20`.

Keep Alive::
+
[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.max_keep_alive = 10000
----
* `max_keep_alive` defines how long connections to the Elasticsearch cluster can be kept idle.
+
Expects a positive <<configuration-property-types,Long value>> in milliseconds, such as `60000`.
+
If the response from an Elasticsearch cluster contains a `Keep-Alive` header,
then the effective max idle time will be whichever is lower:
the duration from the `Keep-Alive` header or the value of this property (if set).
+
If this property is not set, only the `Keep-Alive` header is considered,
and if it's absent, idle connections will be kept forever.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-http-client]]
=== [[_custom_http_client_configurations]] Custom HTTP client configurations

It is possible to configure the HTTP client directly
using an instance of `org.apache.http.impl.nio.client.HttpAsyncClientBuilder`.

With this API you can add interceptors, change the keep alive, the max connections,
the SSL key/trust store settings and many other client configurations.

Configure the HTTP client directly requires two steps:

. Define a class that implements the `org.hibernate.search.backend.elasticsearch.client.ElasticsearchHttpClientConfigurer` interface.
. Configure Hibernate Search to use that implementation by setting the configuration property
`hibernate.search.backend.client.configurer`
to a <<configuration-bean-reference-parsing,bean reference>> pointing to the implementation,
for example `class:org.hibernate.search.documentation.backend.elasticsearch.client.HttpClientConfigurer`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-version]]
== [[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-dialect]] Version compatibility

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-version-check]]
=== Version check on startup

Different distributions and versions of Elasticsearch/OpenSearch expose slightly different APIs.
As a result, Hibernate Search needs to be aware of the distribution and version it is talking to
in order to generate correct HTTP requests.

By default, Hibernate Search will query the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster at boot time to retrieve this information,
and will infer the correct behavior to adopt.

You can force Hibernate Search to expect a specific version of Elasticsearch/OpenSearch by
setting the property `hibernate.search.backend.version` to a version string
following the format `x.y.z-qualifier` or `<distribution>:x.y.z-qualifier`, where:

* `<distribution>` is either `elastic` or `opensearch`. Optional, defaults to `elastic`.
* `x`, `y` and `z` are integers. `x` is mandatory, `y` and `z` are optional.
* `qualifier` is a string of word characters (alphanumeric or `_`). Optional.

For example, `7`, 7.0`, `7.10`, `opensearch:1.0` are all valid version strings.

Hibernate Search will still query the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster
to detect the actual distribution and version of the cluster,
but it will check that the configured distribution and version match the actual ones.
This can be helpful while developing, in particular.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-version-check-disabling]]
=== Disabling the version check on startup

If necessary, you can disable the call to the Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cluster on startup,
and provide the information manually.

To do that, set the property `hibernate.search.backend.version_check.enabled` to `false`.

You will also have to set the property `hibernate.search.backend.version` to a version string
as explained in the <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration-version-check,previous section>>.
In this case, both major **and minor** version numbers (`x` **and `y`** in the formats above)
are mandatory,
but all other components (distribution, micro, qualifier) remain optional.
For example, `7.0`, `7.10`, `opensearch:1.0` are all valid version strings in this case, but `7` is not precise enough.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-logging]]
== [[elasticsearch-log-json-pretty-printing]] Request logging

The `hibernate.search.backend.log.json_pretty_printing` <<configuration-property-types,boolean property>>
defines whether JSON included in <<troubleshooting-logging,request logs>> should be pretty-printed (indented, with line breaks).
It defaults to `false`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-sharding]]
== Sharding

include::../components/_sharding-intro-note.adoc[]

Elasticsearch disables sharding by default.
To enable it,
link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/index-modules.html#_static_index_settings[set the property `index.number_of_shards` in your cluster].

[[backend-elasticsearch-schema-management]]
== [[elasticsearch-schema-management-strategy]] Schema management

Elasticsearch indexes need to be created before they can be used for indexing and searching;
see <<schema-management>> for more information about how to create indexes and their schema
in Hibernate Search.

// Search 6 anchors backward compatibility
[[backend-elasticsearch-index-lifecycle]]
For Elasticsearch specifically, some fine-tuning is available through the following options:

[source]
----
# To configure the defaults for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.schema_management.minimal_required_status = green
hibernate.search.backend.schema_management.minimal_required_status_wait_timeout = 10000
# To configure a specific index:
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.schema_management.minimal_required_status = green
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.schema_management.minimal_required_status_wait_timeout = 10000
----

* `minimal_required_status` defines the minimal required status of an index before creation is considered complete.
The default for this property is `yellow`.
* `minimal_required_status_wait_timeout` defines the maximum time to wait for this status,
as an <<configuration-property-types,integer value>> in milliseconds.
The default for this property is `10000`.

These properties are only effective when creating or validating an index as part of schema management.

[[backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout]]
== Index layout

Hibernate Search works with link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/indices-aliases.html[aliased] indexes.
This means an index with a given name in Hibernate Search will not directly be mapped
to an index with the same name in Elasticsearch.

The index layout is how Hibernate Search index names are mapped to Elasticsearch indexes,
and the strategy controlling that layout is set at the backend level:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.layout.strategy = simple
----

The default for this property is `simple`.

See the following subsections for details about available strategies.

[[backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout-strategy-simple]]
=== `simple`: the default, future-proof strategy

For an index whose name in Hibernate Search is `myIndex`:

* If Hibernate Search <<backend-elasticsearch-schema-management,creates the index automatically>>,
it will name the index `myindex-000001` and will automatically create the write and read aliases.
* Write operations (indexing, purge, ...) will target the alias `myindex-write`.
* Read operations (searching, explaining, ...) will target the alias `myindex-read`.

[TIP]
====
The `simple` layout is a bit more complex than it could be, but it follows the best practices.

Using aliases has a significant advantage over directly targeting the index:
it makes full reindexing on a live application possible without downtime,
which is useful in particular when <<listener-triggered-indexing,listener-triggered indexing>> is disabled
(<<indexing-automatic-configuration,completely>> or <<mapping-reindexing-reindexonupdate,partially>>)
and you need to fully reindex periodically (for example on a daily basis).

With aliases, you just need to direct the read alias (used by search queries) to an old copy of the index,
while the write alias (used by document writes) is redirected to a new copy of the index.
Without aliases (in particular with the `no-alias` layout), this is impossible.

This "zero-downtime" reindexing,
which shares some characteristics with link:https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html["blue/green" deployment],
is not currently provided by Hibernate Search itself.
However, you can implement it in your application
by directly issuing commands to Elasticsearch's REST APIs.
The basic sequence of actions is the following:

1. Create a new index, `myindex-000002`.
2. Switch the write alias, `myindex-write`, from `myindex-000001` to `myindex-000002`.
3. Reindex, for example using the <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexer>>.
4. Switch the read alias, `myindex-read`, from `myindex-000001` to `myindex-000002`.
5. Delete `myindex-000001`.

Note this will only work if the Hibernate Search mapping did not change;
a zero-downtime upgrade with a changing schema would be considerably more complex.
You will find discussions on this topic in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2861[HSEARCH-2861]
and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3499[HSEARCH-3499].
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout-strategy-no-alias]]
=== `no-alias`: a strategy without index aliases

This strategy is mostly useful on legacy clusters.

For an index whose name in Hibernate Search is `myIndex`:

* If Hibernate Search <<backend-elasticsearch-schema-management,creates the index automatically>>,
it will name the index `myindex` and will not create any alias.
* Write operations (indexing, purge, ...) will target the index directly by its name, `myindex`.
* Read operations (searching, explaining, ...) will target the index directly by its name `myindex`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout-strategy-custom]]
=== Custom strategy

If the built-in layout strategies do not fit your requirements,
you can define a custom layout in two simple steps:

. Define a class that implements the interface `org.hibernate.search.backend.elasticsearch.index.layout.IndexLayoutStrategy`.
. Configure the backend to use that implementation by setting the configuration property
`hibernate.search.backend.layout.strategy`
to a <<configuration-bean-reference-parsing,bean reference>> pointing to the implementation,
for example `class:com.mycompany.MyLayoutStrategy`.

For example, the implementation below will lead to the following layout for an index named `myIndex`:

* Write operations (indexing, purge, ...) will target the alias `myindex-write`.
* Read operations (searching, explaining, ...) will target the alias `myindex` (no suffix).
* If Hibernate Search <<backend-elasticsearch-schema-management,creates the index automatically>>
at exactly 19:19:00 on November 6th, 2017,
it will name the index `myindex-20171106-191900-000000000`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-schema]]
== Schema ("mapping")

What Elasticsearch calls the link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/mapping.html["mapping"]
is the schema assigned to each index,
specifying the data type and capabilities of each "property" (called an "index field" in Hibernate Search).

For the most part, the Elasticsearch mapping is inferred from
<<mapping,the mapping configured through Hibernate Search's mapping APIs>>,
which are generic and independent of Elasticsearch.

Aspects that are specific to the Elasticsearch backend are explained in this section.

[TIP]
====
Hibernate Search can be configured to push the mapping to Elasticsearch when creating the indexes
through <<backend-elasticsearch-schema-management,schema management>>.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-field-types]]
=== Field types

[[backend-elasticsearch-field-types-available]]
==== Available field types

[NOTE]
====
Some types are not supported directly by the Elasticsearch backend,
but will work anyway because they are "bridged" by the mapper.
For example a `java.util.Date` in your entity model is "bridged" to `java.time.Instant`,
which is supported by the Elasticsearch backend.
See <<mapping-directfieldmapping-supported-types>> for more information.
====

[NOTE]
====
Field types that are not in this list can still be used with a little bit more work:

* If a property in the entity model has an unsupported type,
but can be converted to a supported type, you will need a bridge.
See <<binding>>.
* If you need an index field with a specific type that is not supported by Hibernate Search,
you will need a bridge that defines a native field type.
See <<backend-elasticsearch-field-types-extension>>.

[[backend-elasticsearch-field-types-date-time,Lower range/resolution]]
[NOTE]
.Range and resolution of date/time fields
====
The Elasticsearch `date` type does not support the whole range of years that can be represented in `java.time` types:

* `java.time` can represent years ranging from `-999.999.999` to `999.999.999`.
* Elasticsearch's `date` type supports dates ranging from year `-292.275.054` to year `292.278.993`.

Values that are out of range will trigger indexing failures.

Resolution is also lower:

* `java.time` supports nanosecond-resolution.
* Elasticsearch's `date` type supports millisecond-resolution.

Precision beyond the millisecond will be lost when indexing.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-field-types-extension]]
==== Index field type DSL extension

Not all Elasticsearch field types have built-in support in Hibernate Search.
Unsupported field types can still be used, however,
by taking advantage of the "native" field type.
Using this field type, the Elasticsearch "mapping" can be defined as JSON directly,
giving access to everything Elasticsearch can offer.

Below is an example of how to use the Elasticearch "native" type.

.Using the Elasticearch "native" type
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/backend/elasticsearch/type/asnative/IpAddressValueBinder.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Define a <<binding,custom binder>> and its bridge.
The "native" type can only be used from a binder,
it cannot be used directly with annotation mapping.
Here we're defining a <<binding-valuebridge,value binder>>,
but a <<binding-typebridge,type binder>>,
or a <<binding-propertybridge,property binder>>
would work as well.
<2> Get the context's type factory.
<3> Apply the Elasticsearch extension to the type factory.
<4> Call `asNative` to start defining a native type.
<5> Pass the Elasticsearch mapping as JSON.
<6> Values of native fields are represented as a `JsonElement` in Hibernate Search.
`JsonElement` is a type from the link:{gsonUrl}[Gson] library.
Do not forget to format them correctly before you pass them to the backend.
Here we are creating a `JsonPrimitive` (a subtype of `JsonElement`) from a `String`
because we just need a JSON string,
but it's completely possible to handle more complex objects,
or even to convert directly from POJOs to JSON using Gson.
<7> For nicer projections, you can also implement this method to convert
from `JsonElement` to the mapped type (here, `String`).

must be mapped using the `@NonStandardField` annotation:
other annotations such as `@GenericField` will fail.
<2> Instruct Hibernate Search to use our custom value binder.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-type-name]]
=== Type name mapping

When Hibernate Search performs a search query targeting multiple entity types, and thus multiple indexes,
it needs to determine the type of each search hit in order to map it back to an entity.

There are multiple strategies to handle this "type name resolution",
and each has pros and cons.

The strategy is set at the backend level:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.mapping.type_name.strategy = discriminator
----
The default for this property is `discriminator`.

See the following subsections for details about available strategies.

[[backend-elasticsearch-type-name-discriminator]]
==== `discriminator`: type name mapping using a discriminator field

With the `discriminator` strategy, a discriminator field is used to retrieve the type name directly from each document.

When indexing, the `_entity_type` field is populated transparently with type name for each document.

When searching, the docvalues for the type field is transparently requested to Elasticsearch
and extracted from the response.

Pros:

* Works correctly when targeting link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/indices-add-alias.html[index aliases].

Cons:

* Small storage overhead: a few bytes of storage per document.
* Requires reindexing if an entity name changes, even if the index name doesn't change.

[[backend-elasticsearch-type-name-index-name]]
==== `index-name`: type name mapping using the index name

With the `index-name` strategy, the `_index` meta-field returned for each search hit
is used to resolve the index name, and from that the type name.

Pros:

* No storage overhead.

Cons:

* Relies on the actual index name, not aliases,
because the `_index` meta-field returned by Elasticsearch
contains the actual index name (e.g. `myindex-000001`), not the alias (e.g. `myindex-read`).
If indexes do not follow the default naming scheme `<hibernateSearchIndexName>-<6 digits>`,
a custom <<backend-elasticsearch-indexlayout,index layout>> must be configured.

[[backend-elasticsearch-mapping-dynamic]]
=== Dynamic mapping

By default, Hibernate Search sets the link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/dynamic.html[`dynamic`] property in Elasticsearch index mappings to `strict`.
This means that attempting to index documents with fields that are not present in the mapping will lead to an indexing failure.

If Hibernate Search is the only client, that won't be a problem,
since Hibernate Search usually works on declared schema fields only.
For the other cases in which we need to change this setting,
we can use the following index-level property to change the value.

[source]
----
# To configure the defaults for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.dynamic_mapping = strict
# To configure a specific index:
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.dynamic_mapping = strict
----
The default for this property is `strict`.

We said that Hibernate Search **usually** works on declared schema fields. More precisely, it always does
if no <<binding-index-field-dsl-dynamic>> are defined.
When field templates are defined, `dynamic` will be forced to `true`, in order to allow for dynamic fields. In that case, the value of the `dynamic_mapping` property is ignored.

[[backend-elasticsearch-multi-tenancy]]
=== Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy is supported and handled transparently,
according to the tenant ID defined in the current session:

* documents will be indexed with the appropriate values, allowing later filtering;
* queries will filter results appropriately.

The multi-tenancy is automatically enabled in the backend if it is enabled in the mapper,
e.g. if link:{hibernateDocUrl}#multitenacy[a multi-tenancy strategy is selected in Hibernate ORM],
or if <<mapper-pojo-standalone-multi-tenancy,multi-tenancy is explicitly configured in the Standalone POJO mapper>>.

However, it is possible to enable multi-tenancy manually.

The multi-tenancy strategy is set at the backend level:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.multi_tenancy.strategy = none
----

See the following subsections for details about available strategies.

[[backend-elasticsearch-multi-tenancy-none]]
==== `none`: single-tenancy

The `none` strategy (the default) disables multi-tenancy completely.

Attempting to set a tenant ID will lead to a failure when indexing.

[[backend-elasticsearch-multi-tenancy-discriminator]]
==== `discriminator`: type name mapping using the index name

With the `discriminator` strategy,
all documents from all tenants are stored in the same index.
The Elasticsearch ID of each document is set to the concatenation of the tenant ID and original ID.

When indexing, two fields are populated transparently for each document:

* `+_tenant_id+`: the "discriminator" field holding the tenant ID.
* `+_tenant_doc_id+`: a field holding the original (tenant-scoped) document ID.

When searching, a filter targeting the tenant ID field is added transparently to the search query
to only return search hits for the current tenant.
The ID field is used to retrieve the original document IDs.

[[backend-elasticsearch-mapping-custom]]
=== [[_custom_index_mapping]] Custom index mapping

[[backend-elasticsearch-mapping-custom-basics]]
==== Basics

Hibernate Search can <<schema-management,create and validate indexes>>,
but by default created indexes will only include the bare minimum required to index and search:
the mapping, and the analysis settings.
Should you need to customize some link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/mapping-params.html[mapping parameters],
it is possible to provide a custom mapping to Hibernate Search:
it will include the custom mapping when creating an index.

[CAUTION]
====
The consistency of the custom Elasticsearch mapping with the Hibernate Search mapping will not get checked in any way.
You are responsible for making sure that any override in your mapping can work,
e.g. that you're not changing the type of an index field from `text` to `integer`,
or disabling `doc_values` on a field used for sorting.

An invalid custom mapping may not trigger any exception on bootstrap, but later while indexing or querying.
In the worst case, it could not trigger any exception, but simply lead to incorrect search results.
Exercise extreme caution.
====

[source]
----
# To configure the defaults for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.schema_management.mapping_file = custom/index-mapping.json
# To configure a specific index:

----
include::{resourcesdir}/custom/index-mapping.json[]
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Properties that are only defined in the custom mappings file but not mapped by Hibernate Search
will not be visible to Hibernate Search.

This means Hibernate Search will throw exceptions if you try to reference these properties in the <<search-dsl,Search DSL>>,
or when <<binding-index-field-dsl-dynamic,writing to a document from a bridge>>
====

The file does not need to contain the full mapping: Hibernate Search will automatically inject
missing properties (index fields) in the given mapping.

Conflicts between the given mapping and the mapping generated by Hibernate Search will be handled as follows:

1. The `dynamic_templates`/`_routing`/`dynamic` mapping parameters
will be those from the given mapping, falling back to the value generated by Hibernate Search (if any).
2. Any other mapping parameters besides the `properties` at the root of the mapping
will be those from the given mapping; those generated by Hibernate Search will be ignored.
3. `properties` will be merged, using properties defined in both the
given mapping and the mapping generated by Hibernate Search.
4. If a property is defined on both sides, it will be merged recursively, following steps 1-4.

In the example above, the resulting, merged mapping could look like this:

.Possible resulting mapping after merging the content of `custom/index-mapping.json` with the Hibernate Search mapping

----

----
<1> This property is always added by Hibernate Search for internal implementation purposes.
<2> This is a property generated by Hibernate Search because the indexed entity
has a `String name` property annotated with `@FullTextField`.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-mapping-custom-disabling-source]]
==== [[_disable_source]] Disabling `_source`

Using this feature it is possible to link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/mapping-source-field.html[disable the `_source` field].
For instance, you could pass a `custom/index-mapping.json` file like the following:

.Possible content of `custom/index-mapping.json` file to disable the `_source` field
====
[source, JSON, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
{
  "_source": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
----
====
[WARNING]
====
Disabling the `_source` is useful to reduce the size of Elasticsearch indexes on the filesystem, but it comes at a cost.

Several <<search-dsl-projection,projections>> rely on the `_source` being enabled.
If you try to use projections with `_source` disabled, behavior is undefined: the search query may return `null` hits, or it may fail completely with exceptions.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-analysis]]
== [[elasticsearch-mapping-analyzer]] Analysis

[[backend-elasticsearch-analysis-basics]]
=== Basics

<<concepts-analysis,Analysis>> is the text processing performed by analyzers,
both when indexing (document processing)
and when searching (query processing).

All <<backend-elasticsearch-analysis-builtin,built-in Elasticsearch analyzers>> can be used transparently,
without any configuration in Hibernate Search:
just use their name wherever Hibernate Search expects an analyzer name.
However, analysis can also be configured explicitly.

[CAUTION]
====
Elasticsearch analysis configuration is not applied immediately on startup:
it needs to be pushed to the Elasticsearch cluster.

Hibernate Search will only push the configuration to the cluster if instructed to do so
through <<schema-management,schema management>>.
====

To configure analysis in an Elasticsearch backend, you will need to:

. Define a class that implements the `org.hibernate.search.backend.elasticsearch.analysis.ElasticsearchAnalysisConfigurer` interface.
. Configure the backend to use that implementation by setting the configuration property
`hibernate.search.backend.analysis.configurer`
to a <<configuration-bean-reference-parsing,bean reference>> pointing to the implementation,
for example `class:com.mycompany.MyAnalysisConfigurer`.

TIP: You can pass multiple bean references separated by commas. See <<configuration-property-types>>.

Hibernate Search will call the `configure` method of this implementation on startup,
and the configurer will be able to take advantage of a DSL to define
<<backend-elasticsearch-analysis-analyzers,analyzers and normalizers>>.

[NOTE]
====
A different analysis configurer can be assigned to each index:

[source]
----
# To set the default configurer for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.analysis.configurer = class:com.mycompany.MyAnalysisConfigurer
# To assign a specific configurer to a specific index:
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.analysis.configurer = class:com.mycompany.MySpecificAnalysisConfigurer
----

If a specific configurer is assigned to an index,
the default configurer will be ignored for that index:
only definitions from the specific configurer will be taken into account.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-analysis-builtin]]
=== Built-in analyzers

Built-in analyzers are available out-of-the-box and don't require explicit configuration.
If necessary, they can be overridden by defining your own analyzer with the same name.

The Elasticsearch backend comes with several built-in analyzers.
The exact list depends on the version of Elasticsearch and can be found
link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/analysis-analyzers.html[here].

Regardless of the Elasticsearch version,
analyzers whose name is listed as a constant in `org.hibernate.search.engine.backend.analysis.AnalyzerNames`
are always available:

`default`::
The analyzer used by default with <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-fulltextfield,`@FullTextField`>>.
+
This is just an alias for `standard` by default.
`standard`::
Default behavior: first, tokenize using the standard tokenizer, which follows Word Break rules from the
Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm, as specified in http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/[Unicode Standard Annex #29].
Then, lowercase each token.
`simple`::
Default behavior: first, split the text at non-letter characters.
Then, lowercase each token.
`whitespace`::
Default behavior: split the text at whitespace characters.
Do not change the tokens.
`stop`::
Default behavior: first, split the text at non-letter characters.
Then, lowercase each token.
Finally, remove English stop words.
`keyword`::
Default behavior: do not change the text in any way.
+
With this analyzer a full text field would behave similarly to a keyword field,
but with fewer features: no terms aggregations, for example.
+
Consider using a <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-keywordfield,`@KeywordField`>> instead.

[[backend-elasticsearch-analysis-builtin-normalizer]]
=== Built-in normalizers

The Elasticsearch backend does not provide any built-in normalizer.

[[backend-elasticsearch-analysis-analyzers]]
=== Custom analyzers and normalizers

The context passed to the configurer exposes a DSL to define analyzers and normalizers:

<1> Define a custom analyzer named "english", because it will be used to analyze English text such as book titles.
<2> Set the tokenizer to a standard tokenizer.
<3> Set the char filters. Char filters are applied in the order they are given, before the tokenizer.
<4> Set the token filters. Token filters are applied in the order they are given, after the tokenizer.
<5> Note that, for Elasticsearch, any parameterized char filter, tokenizer or token filter
must be defined separately and assigned a name.
<6> Set the value of a parameter for the char filter/tokenizer/token filter being defined.
<7> Normalizers are defined in a similar way, the only difference being that they cannot use a tokenizer.
<8> Multiple analyzers/normalizers can be defined in the same configurer.

[[backend-elasticsearch-analysis-analyzers-default]]
=== Overriding the default analyzer

The default analyzer when using <<mapping-directfieldmapping-annotations-fulltextfield,`@FullTextField`>>
without specifying an analyzer explicitly, is named `default`.

Like any other <<backend-elasticsearch-analysis-builtin,built-in analyzer>>, it is possible to override the default analyzer
by defining a <<backend-elasticsearch-analysis-analyzers,custom analyzer>> with the same name:

.Overriding the default analyzer in the Elasticsearch backend

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-index-settings]]
== [[_custom_index_settings]] Custom index settings

Hibernate Search can <<schema-management,create and validate indexes>>, but by default created indexes will only include the bare minimum required to index and search: the mapping, and the analysis settings.
Should you need to set some link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings[custom index settings], it is possible to provide these settings to Hibernate Search: it will include them when creating an index and take them into account when validating an index.

[source]
----
# To configure the defaults for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.schema_management.settings_file = custom/index-settings.json
# To configure a specific index:
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.schema_management.settings_file = custom/index-settings.json
----

.Possible content of `custom/index-settings.json` file
====
[source, JSON, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{resourcesdir}/custom/index-settings.json[]
----
====

The provided settings will be merged with those generated by Hibernate Search, including analyzer definitions.
When analysis is configured both through an <<backend-elasticsearch-analysis-analyzers,analysis configurer>> and these custom settings, the behavior is undefined; it should not be relied upon.

[NOTE]
====
Custom index setting must be provided in the simplified form, the one without the attribute the `index` attribute.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-configuration-index-settings-max-result-window-size]]
=== [[_max_result_window_size]] Max result window size

If the setting `index.max_result_window` is used,
Hibernate Search will use this value to limit the returning hits size
if no limit has been defined on the query by the user.
In this case if Hibernate Search notices there are more results, a warning will be logged.

[[backend-elasticsearch-threads]]
== Threads

The Elasticsearch backend relies on an internal thread pool to orchestrate indexing requests (add/update/delete)
and to schedule request timeouts.

By default, the pool contains exactly as many threads as the number of processors available to the JVM on bootstrap.
That can be changed using a configuration property:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.thread_pool.size = 4
----

[NOTE]
====
This number is _per backend_, not per index.
Adding more indexes will not add more threads.
====

[TIP]
====
As all operations happening in this thread-pool are non-blocking,
raising its size above the number of processor cores available to the JVM will not bring
noticeable performance benefits.

The only reason to alter this setting would be to reduce the number of threads;
for example, in an application with a single index with a single indexing queue,
running on a machine with 64 processor cores,
you might want to bring down the number of threads.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-indexing-queues]]
== Indexing queues

Among all the requests sent by Hibernate Search to Elasticsearch,
it is expected that there will be a lot of "indexing" requests to create/update/delete a specific document.
Sending these requests one by one would be inefficient (mainly because of network latency).
Also, we generally want to preserve the relative order of these requests
when they are about the same documents.

For these reasons, Hibernate Search pushes these requests to ordered queues
and relies on the link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/docs-bulk.html[Bulk API] to send them in batches.
Each index maintains 10 queues holding at most 1000 elements each,
and each queue will send bulk requests of at most 100 indexing requests.
Queues operate independently (in parallel), but each queue sends one bulk request after the other,
so at any given time there can be at most 10 bulk requests being sent for each index.

[NOTE]
====
Indexing operations relative to the same document ID are always pushed to the same queue.
====

It is possible to customize the queues in order to reduce the load on the Elasticsearch server,
or on the contrary to improve throughput.
This is done through the following configuration properties:

[source]
----
# To configure the defaults for all indexes:
hibernate.search.backend.indexing.queue_count = 10
hibernate.search.backend.indexing.queue_size = 1000
hibernate.search.backend.indexing.max_bulk_size = 100
# To configure a specific index:
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.indexing.queue_count = 10
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.indexing.queue_size = 1000
hibernate.search.backend.indexes.<index-name>.indexing.max_bulk_size = 100
----

* `indexing.queue_count` defines the number of queues.
Expects a strictly positive integer value.
The default for this property is `10`.
+
Higher values will lead to more connections being used in parallel,
which may lead to higher indexing throughput,
but incurs a risk of <<backend-elasticsearch-indexing-queues-circuit-breaker,overloading Elasticsearch>>,
leading to Elasticsearch giving up on some requests and resulting in indexing failures.
* `indexing.queue_size` defines the maximum number of elements each queue can hold.
Expects a strictly positive integer value.
The default for this property is `1000`.
+
Lower values may lead to lower memory usage, especially if there are many queues,
but values that are too low will reduce the likeliness of reaching the max bulk size
and increase the likeliness of <<backend-elasticsearch-indexing-queues-blocking,application threads blocking>>
because the queue is full,
which may lead to lower indexing throughput.
* `indexing.max_bulk_size` defines the maximum number of indexing requests in each bulk request.
Expects a strictly positive integer value.
The default for this property is `100`.
+
Higher values will lead to more documents being sent in each HTTP request sent to Elasticsearch,
which may lead to higher indexing throughput,
but incurs a risk of <<backend-elasticsearch-indexing-queues-circuit-breaker,overloading Elasticsearch>>,
leading to Elasticsearch giving up on some requests and resulting in indexing failures.
+
Note that raising this number above the queue size has no effect,
as bulks cannot include more requests than are contained in the queue.

[TIP]
[[backend-elasticsearch-indexing-queues-blocking]]
====
When a queue is full, any attempt to request indexing will block until the request can be put into the queue.

In order to achieve a reasonable level of performance,
be sure to set the size of queues to a high enough number that this kind of blocking only happens
when the application is under very high load.
====

[WARNING]
[[backend-elasticsearch-indexing-queues-circuit-breaker]]
====
Elasticsearch nodes can only handle so many parallel requests,
and in particular they link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/circuit-breaker.html[limit the amount of memory]
available to store all pending requests at any given time.

In order to avoid indexing failures, avoid using overly large numbers
for the number of queues and the maximum bulk size,
especially if you expect your index to hold large documents.
====

[[backend-elasticsearch-io]]
== Writing and reading

include::../components/_writing-reading-intro-note.adoc[]

[[backend-elasticsearch-io-commit]]
=== Commit

When writing to indexes, Elasticsearch relies on a link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/index-modules-translog.html[transaction log]
to make sure that changes, even uncommitted, are always safe as soon as the REST API call returns.

For that reason, the concept of "commit" is not as important to the Elasticsearch backend,
and commit requirements are largely irrelevant.

[[backend-elasticsearch-io-refresh]]
=== Refresh

When reading from indexes, Elasticsearch relies on a periodically refreshed index reader,
meaning that search queries will return slightly out-of-date results,
unless a refresh was forced:
this is called link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/getting-started-concepts.html#_near_realtime_nrt[near-real-time] behavior.

By default, the index reader is refreshed every second,
but this can be customized on the Elasticsearch side through index settings:
see the `refresh_interval` setting on link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/index-modules.html[this page].

[[backend-elasticsearch-search]]
== Searching

Searching with the Elasticsearch backend relies on the <<search-dsl,same APIs as any other backend>>.

This section details Elasticsearch-specific configuration related to searching.

[[backend-elasticsearch-search-scroll-timeout]]
=== Scroll timeout

With the Elasticsearch backend, <<search-dsl-query-fetching-results-scrolling,scrolls>> are subject to timeout.
If `next()` is not called for a long period of time (default: 60 seconds),
the scroll will be closed automatically and the next call to `next()` will fail.

Use the following configuration property at the backend level to configure the timeout (in seconds):

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.scroll_timeout = 60
----
The default for this property is `60`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-search-ignore-partial-shard-failure]]
=== Partial shard failure

With the Elasticsearch backend, <<search-dsl-query-fetching-results,fetching results>> may result in partial shard failures,
i.e. some of the shards will fail to produce results while the others will succeed.
In such situations, an Elasticsearch cluster will produce a response with a successful status code, but will contain additional
information on failed shards, and the reason they have failed.

By default, Hibernate Search will check if any shards have failed while fetching the results and if so -- will throw an exception.

Use the following configuration property at the backend level to change the default behaviour:

[source]
----
hibernate.search.backend.query.shard_failure.ignore = true
----
The default for this property is `false`.

[[backend-elasticsearch-access-client]]
== [[elasticsearch-client-access]] Retrieving the REST client

When writing complex applications with advanced requirements,
it may be necessary from time to time to send requests to the Elasticsearch cluster directly,
in particular if Hibernate Search does not support this kind of requests out of the box.

To that end, you can retrieve the Elasticsearch backend,
then get access the Elasticsearch client used by Hibernate Search internally.
See below for an example.

.Accessing the low-level REST client

[WARNING]
====
The client itself is not part of the Hibernate Search API,
but of the
link:{elasticsearchDocUrl}/index-modules.html#_static_index_settings[official Elasticsearch REST client API].

Hibernate Search may one day switch to another client with a different Java type,
without prior notice.
If that happens, the snippet of code above will throw an exception.
