[[search-dsl-sort-concepts]]
== Basics

By default, query results are sorted by <<search-dsl-sort-score,matching score (relevance)>>.
Other sorts, including the sort by field value, can be configured when building the search query:

<1> <<entrypoints-search-session,Retrieve the `SearchSession`>>.
<2> Start building the query as usual.
<3> Mention that the results of the query are expected to be sorted on field "pageCount" in descending order,
then (for those with the same page count) on field "title_sort" in ascending order.
If the field does not exist or cannot be sorted on, an exception will be thrown.
<4> Fetch the results, which will be sorted according to instructions.

The sort DSL offers more sort types, and multiple options for each type of sort.
To learn more about the `field` sort, and all the other types of sort,
refer to the following sections.

[[search-dsl-sort-score]]
== `score`: sort by matching score (relevance)

`score` sorts on the score of each document:

* in descending order (the default), documents with a higher score appear first in the list of hits.
* in ascending order, documents with a lower score appear first in the list of hits.

The score is computed differently for each query,
but roughly speaking you can consider that a higher score means that more <<search-dsl-predicate,predicates>>
were matched, or they were matched better.
Thus, the score of a given document is a representation of how relevant that document is to a particular query.

[TIP]
====
To get the most out of a sort by score, you will need
to <<search-dsl-predicate-common-score,assign weight to your predicates by boosting some of them>>.

Advanced users may even want to change the scoring formula by specifying a different <<backend-lucene-analysis-similarity,Similarity>>.
====

Sorting by score is the default, so it's generally not necessary to ask for a sort by score explicitly,
but below is an example of how you can do it.

.Sorting by relevance

----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=score]
----
====

[[search-dsl-sort-score-options]]
=== Options

* You can sort by ascending score by <<search-dsl-sort-common-order,changing the sort order>>.
However, this means the least relevant hits will appear first,
which is completely pointless. This option is only provided for completeness.

[[search-dsl-sort-index-order]]
== `indexOrder`: sort according to the order of documents on storage

`indexOrder` sorts on the position of documents on internal storage.

This sort is not predictable, but is the most efficient.
Use it when performance matters more than the order of hits.

.Sorting according to the order of documents on storage
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=indexOrder]
----
====

NOTE: `indexOrder` should *not* be used to stabilize sorts.
That's because the index order may change when the index is updated,
or even without any change, after index segments are <<backend-lucene-io-merge,merged>>.
See <<search-dsl-sort-stabilize>> for a solution to unstable sorts.

[[search-dsl-sort-field]]
== `field`: sort by field values

`field` sorts on the value of a given field for each document.

[[search-dsl-sort-field-prerequisites]]
include::../components/_field-sort-important.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The values of <<mapping-geopoint,GeoPoint>> fields cannot be compared directly
and thus the `field` sort cannot be used on those fields.

Refer to the <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance sort>> for these fields.
====

The sort order is defined as follows:

* in ascending order (the default), documents with a lower value appear first in the list of hits.
* in descending order, documents with a higher value appear first in the list of hits.

[NOTE]
====
For text fields, "lower" means "lower in the alphabetical order".

[[search-dsl-sort-field-options]]
=== Options

* The sort order is ascending by default,
but can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-order,controlled explicitly with `.asc()`/`.desc()`>>.
* The behavior on missing values
can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-missing,controlled explicitly with `.missing()`>>.
* The behavior on multivalued fields
can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-multi-value-mode,controlled explicitly with `.mode(...)`>>.
* For fields in nested objects, all nested objects are considered by default,
but that can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-filter,controlled explicitly with `.filter(...)`>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-distance]]
== `distance`: sort by distance to a point

`distance` sorts on the distance from a given center to the geo-point value of a given field for each document.

* in ascending order (the default), documents with a lower distance appear first in the list of hits.
* in descending order, documents with a higher distance appear first in the list of hits.

[[search-dsl-sort-distance-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

In order for the `distance` sort to be available on a given field,
you need to mark the field as <<mapping-directfieldmapping-sortable,sortable>> in the mapping.

* For fields in nested objects, all nested objects are considered by default,
but that can be <<search-dsl-sort-common-filter,controlled explicitly with `.filter(...)`>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-composite]]
== `composite`: combine sorts

`composite` applies multiple sorts one after the other.
It is useful when applying incomplete sorts.

.Sorting by multiple composed sorts using `composite()`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=composite]
----
<1> Start a `composite` sort.
<2> Add a `field` sort on the `genre_sort` field.
Since many books share the same genre, this sort is incomplete:
the relative order of books with the same genre is undetermined,
and may change from one query execution to the other.
<3> Add a `field` sort on the `title_sort` field.
When two books have the same genre,
their relative order will be determined by comparing their titles.
If two books can have the same title,
we can <<search-dsl-sort-stabilize,stabilize the sort even further by adding a last sort on the id>>.
<4> The hits will be sorted by genre, then by title.
====

Alternatively, you can append a sort to another simply by calling `.then()` after the first sort:

[[search-dsl-sort-composite-lambda]]
=== Adding sorts dynamically with the lambda syntax

It is possible to define the `composite` sort inside a lambda expression.
This is especially useful when inner sorts need to be added dynamically to the `composite` sort,
for example based on user input.

.Easily composing sorts dynamically with the lambda syntax
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0, subs="+callouts"]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=composite_dynamicParameters]
----
<1> Get a custom object holding the search parameters provided by the user through a web form, for example.
<2> Call `.composite(Consumer)`.
The consumer, implemented by a lambda expression, will receive a builder as an argument
and will add sorts to that builder as necessary.
<3> Inside the lambda, the code is free to do whatever is necessary before adding sorts.
In this case, we iterate over user-selected sorts and add sorts accordingly.
<4> The hits will be sorted according to sorts added by the lambda expression.
====

[[search-dsl-sort-stabilize]]
=== Stabilizing a sort

If your first sort (e.g. by <<search-dsl-sort-field,field value>>)
results in a tie for many documents (e.g. many documents have the same field value),
you may want to append an arbitrary sort just to stabilize your sort:
to make sure the search hits will always be in the same order if you execute the same query.

In most cases, a quick and easy solution for stabilizing a sort is
to change your mapping to add a <<mapping-directfieldmapping-sortable,sortable field>> on your entity ID,
and to append a `field` sort by id to your unstable sort:

[[search-dsl-sort-extensions]]
== Backend-specific extensions

By calling `.extension(...)` while building a query,
it is possible to access backend-specific sorts.

[NOTE]
====
As their name suggests, backend-specific sorts are not portable from one backend technology to the other.

[[search-dsl-sort-common]]
== Options common to multiple sort types

[[search-dsl-sort-common-order]]
=== Sort order

Most sorts use the ascending order by default, with the notable exception of the <<search-dsl-sort-score,score sort>>.

The order controlled explicitly through the following options:

* `.asc()` for an ascending order.
* `.desc()` for a descending order.
* `.order(...)` for an order defined by the given argument: `SortOrder.ASC`/`SortOrder.DESC`.

Below are a few examples with the <<search-dsl-sort-field,field sort>>.

include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/search/sort/SortDslIT.java[tags=order-order]
----
====

[[search-dsl-sort-common-missing]]
=== [[_handling_missing_values]] Missing values

By default:

* For <<search-dsl-sort-field,sorts by field values>>, the documents that do not have any value for a sort field
  will appear in the last position.
* For <<search-dsl-sort-distance,sorts by distance to a point>>, the documents that do not have any value for a sort field
  will be treated as if their distance from the given point was infinite.

The behavior for missing values can be controlled explicitly through the `.missing()` option:

* `.missing().first()` puts documents with no value in first position (regardless of the sort order).
* `.missing().last()` puts documents with no value in last position (regardless of the sort order).
* `.missing().lowest()` interprets missing values as the lowest value:
it puts documents with no value in the first position when using ascending order or in the last position when using descending order.
* `.missing().highest()` interprets missing values as the highest value:
it puts documents with no value in the last position when using ascending order or in the first position when using descending order.
* `.missing().use(...)` uses the given value as a default for documents with no value.

[NOTE]
====
All these options are supported for sorts by field values and sorts by distance to a point
using the Lucene backend.

When sorting by distance to a point using the Elasticsearch backend, due to limitations of the Elasticsearch APIs,
only the following combinations are supported:

* `.missing().first()` using a descending order.
* `.missing().last()` using an ascending order.
* `.missing().highest()` using either an ascending or a descending order.

====

[[search-dsl-sort-common-missing-argument-type]]
==== Expected type of arguments

By default, `.use(...)` expects its argument to have the same type as
the entity property corresponding to the target field.

For example, if an entity property is of type `java.util.Date`,
<<mapping-directfieldmapping-supported-types,the corresponding field may be of type `java.time.Instant`>>.
`.use(...)` will expect its argument to be of type `java.util.Date` regardless.

This should generally be what you want,
but if you ever need to bypass conversion and pass an unconverted argument
(of type `java.time.Instant` in the example above)
to `.use(...)`, see <<search-dsl-argument-type>>.

[[search-dsl-sort-common-multi-value-mode]]
=== Sort mode for multivalued fields

Documents that have multiple values for a sort field can be sorted too.
A single value is picked for each document in order to compare it with order documents.
How the value is picked is called the *sort mode*, specified using the `.mode(...)` option.
The following sort modes are available:

|====
|Mode|Description|Supported value types|Unsupported value types
|`SortMode.MIN`
|Picks the lowest value for field sorts, the lowest distance for distance sorts.

This is default for ascending sorts.
|All.
|-
|`SortMode.MAX`
|Picks the highest value for field sorts, the highest distance for distance sorts.

This is default for descending sorts.
|All.
|-
|`SortMode.SUM`
|Computes the sum of all values for each document,
and picks that sum for comparison with other documents.
|Numeric fields (`long`, ...).
|Text and temporal fields (`String`, `LocalDate`, ...), <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance>>.
|`SortMode.AVG`
|Computes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean[arithmetic mean] of all values for each document
and picks that average for comparison with other documents.
|Numeric and temporal fields (`long`, `LocalDate`, ...), <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance>>.
|Text fields (`String`, ...).
|`SortMode.MEDIAN`
|Computes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median[median] of all values for each document,
and picks that median for comparison with other documents.
|Numeric and temporal fields (`long`, `LocalDate`, ...), <<search-dsl-sort-distance,distance>>.
|Text fields (`String`, ...).

=== Filter for fields in nested objects

When the sort field is located in a <<mapping-indexedembedded-structure-nested,nested object>>,
by default all nested objects will be considered for the sort
and their values will be combined using the configured <<search-dsl-sort-common-multi-value-mode,sort mode>>.

It is possible to filter the nested documents whose values will be considered for the sort
using one of the `filter(...)` methods.

Below is an example with the <<search-dsl-sort-field,field sort>>:
authors are sorted by the average page count of their books,
but only books of the "crime fiction" genre are considered:
