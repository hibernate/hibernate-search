[[mapper-pojo-standalone-basics]]
== Basics

The Standalone POJO <<architecture-hsearch-components-mapper,Mapper>> enables mapping arbitrary POJOs to indexes.

Its key feature compared to the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>
is its ability to run without Hibernate ORM or a relational database.

It can be used to index entities coming from an arbitrary datastore
or even (though that's not recommended in general)
to use Lucene or Elasticsearch as a primary datastore.

Because the Standalone POJO Mapper does not assume anything about the entities being mapped,
beyond the fact they are represented as POJOs,
it can be more complex to use than the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>.
In particular:

* This mapper <<mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-listener-triggered,cannot detect entity changes on its own>>:
all indexing <<mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-plan,must be explicit>>.
* Loading of entities as hits in the result of a <<search-dsl-query,search query>>
must be <<mapper-pojo-standalone-search-query-loading,implemented on a case-by-case basis>>.
* Loading of identifiers and entities for <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexing>>
must be <<mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-massindexer,implemented on a case-by-case basis>>.
* This mapper <<mapper-pojo-standalone-coordination,does not provide coordination between nodes>>
at the moment.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-startup]]
== Startup

Starting up Hibernate Search with the Standalone POJO Mapper is explicit and involves a builder:

.Starting up Hibernate Search with the Standalone POJO Mapper and Configurer
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/entrypoints/StandalonePojoConfigurer.java[tags=configurer]
----
<1> Declare *all* entity types that Hibernate Search may need to work with.
<2> Set additional configuration exposed through the context.
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/entrypoints/StandalonePojoEntryPointsIT.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create a builder, passing an `AnnotatedTypeSource` to let Hibernate Search know where to look for annotations.
<2> Set configurer.
<3> Set additional configuration properties (see also <<configuration>>).
<4> Build the `SearchMapping`.
====

[TIP]
====
Thanks to <<mapping-classpath-scanning,classpath scanning>>,
your `AnnotatedTypeSource` only needs to include one class
from each JAR containing annotated types.
Other types should be automatically discovered.

See also <<mapping-classpath-scanning-faster,this section>>
to troubleshoot or improve performance of classpath scanning.
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-shutdown]]
== Shutdown

You can shut down Hibernate Search with the Standalone POJO Mapper by calling the `close()` method on the mapping:

.Shutting down Hibernate Search with the Standalone POJO Mapper
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/entrypoints/StandalonePojoEntryPointsIT.java[tags=shutdown]
----
<1> Retrieve the `SearchMapping` that was returned when <<mapper-pojo-standalone-startup,Hibernate Search started>>.
<2> Call `close()` to shut down Hibernate Search.
====

On shutdown, Hibernate Search will stop accepting new indexing requests:
new indexing attempts will throw exceptions.
The `close()` method will only return once all ongoing indexing operations complete.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-beanprovider]]
== Bean provider

include::../components/_incubating-warning.adoc[]

The Standalone POJO Mapper can <<configuration-bean,retrieve beans from CDI/Spring>>,
but that support needs to be implemented explicitly through a bean provider.

You can plug in your own bean provider in two steps:

. Define a class that implements the `org.hibernate.search.engine.environment.bean.spi.BeanProvider` interface.
. Configure Hibernate Search to use that implementation by setting the configuration property
`hibernate.search.bean_provider`
to a <<configuration-bean-reference-parsing,bean reference>> pointing to the implementation,
for example `class:com.mycompany.MyMappingConfigurer`.
Obviously, the reference to the bean provider cannot be resolved using the bean provider.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-multi-tenancy]]
== Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy needs to be enabled explicitly when starting the Standalone POJO Mapper:

.Enabling multi-tenancy with the Standalone POJO Mapper
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/multitenancy/StandalonePojoMultiTenancyIT.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create a builder.
<2> Enable multi-tenancy.
<3> Build the `SearchMapping`.
====

Once multi-tenancy is enabled, a tenant ID will have to be provided when creating a `SearchSession` and in some other cases
(creating a <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexer>>, a <<indexing-workspace,workspace>>, ...).

.Creating the `SearchSession` with a tenant identifier
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/multitenancy/StandalonePojoMultiTenancyIT.java[tags=searchSession]
----
<1> <<entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-pojo-standalone,Retrieve the `SearchMapping`>>.
<2> Start creating a new session.
<3> Set the tenant identifier for the new session.
<4> Build the new session.
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-mapping]]
== Mapping

While the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>> can infer parts of the mapping from the Hibernate ORM mapping,
the Standalone POJO Mapper cannot.
As a result, the Standalone POJO Mapper needs more explicit configuration
for its mapping:

* Entity types must be listed explicitly on <<mapper-pojo-standalone-startup,startup>>.
* Document identifiers must be <<mapping-identifiermapping-explicit,mapped explicitly>>.
* The inverse side of associations must be <<mapping-reindexing-associationinverseside,mapped explicitly>>.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing]]
== Indexing

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-listener-triggered]]
=== [[mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-automatic]] Listener-triggered indexing

The Standalone POJO Mapper does not provide "implicit" indexing
similar to the <<listener-triggered-indexing,listener-triggered indexing>> in the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>.

Instead, you must index explicitly with an <<mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-plan,indexing plan>>.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-plan]]
=== Explicitly indexing on entity change events

The Standalone POJO Mapper can process entity change events (add, update, delete)
and perform indexing accordingly,
though events must necessarily be passed to Hibernate Search explicitly.
See <<indexing-plan>> for more information about the API.

One major difference with the <<mapper-orm,Hibernate ORM integration>>
is that transactions (JTA or otherwise are not supported),
so indexing is executed on <<entrypoints-search-session-mapper-pojo-standalone,session closing>>
rather than on transaction commit.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-indexing-massindexer]]
=== Mass indexing

Because by default, the Standalone POJO Mapper does not know anything about where the entity data comes from,
<<indexing-massindexer,mass indexing>> requires plugging in a way to load entities from the other datastore.

This is done on <<mapper-pojo-standalone-startup,startup>>
by assigning a `MassLoadingStrategy` to each entity type that will require reindexing:

.Assigning mass loading strategies with the Standalone POJO Mapper
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/loading/StandalonePojoMassLoadingIT.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Retrieve a reference to an implementation-specific datastore.
<2> Create a builder.
<3> Declare an entity type, and assign it a `MassLoadingStrategy`
(which must somehow have access to the datastore).
<4> Build the `SearchMapping`.
====

Once all types to reindex have their mass loading strategy implemented and assigned,
they can be reindexed using the <<indexing-massindexer,mass indexer>>:

.Mass indexing with the Standalone POJO Mapper
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/loading/StandalonePojoMassLoadingIT.java[tags=massIndexer]
----
<1> <<entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-pojo-standalone,Retrieve the `SearchMapping`>>.
<2> Create a `MassIndexer` targeting every indexed entity type.
<3> Start the mass indexing process and return when it is over.
====

Below is an example of `MassLoadingStrategy` implementation for an imaginary datastore.

.Implementing `MassLoadingStrategy`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/loading/MyMassLoadingStrategy.java[tags=include]
----
<1> The strategy must have access to the datastore to be able to open connections,
but it should not generally have any open connection.
<2> Implement an identifier loader to retrieve the identifiers of all entities that will have to be indexed.
Hibernate Search will only call this method once per mass indexing.
<3> Retrieve the <<indexing-massindexer-parameters-batchsizetoloadobjects,batch size>> configured on the `MassIndexer`.
This defines how many IDs (at most) must be returned in each `List` passed to the sink.
<4> Retrieve the list of entity types to be loaded:
Hibernate Search may request loading of multiple types from a single loader
if those types share similar mass loading strategies (see tips/warnings below).
<5> The identifier loader owns a connection exclusively: it should create one when it's created, and close it when it's closed.
Related: the identifier loader always executes in the same thread.
<6> Count the number of entities to index.
This is just an estimate: it can be off to some extent,
but that will lead to incorrect reporting in the <<indexing-massindexer-parameters-monitor,monitor>> (by default, the logs).
<7> Retrieve identifiers in successive batches, one per call to `loadNext()`, and pass them to the sink.
<8> When there are no more identifiers to load, let the sink know by calling `complete()`.
<9> Implement an entity loader to actually load entities from the identifiers retrieved above.
Hibernate Search will call this method multiple times for a single mass indexing,
to create <<indexing-massindexer-parameters-threadstoloadobjects,multiple loaders>> that execute in parallel.
<10> Each entity loader owns a connection exclusively: it should create one when it's created, and close it when it's closed.
Related: each entity loader always executes in the same thread.
<11> Load the entities corresponding to the identifiers passed in argument and pass them to the sink.
Entities passed to the sink do not need to be the same order as the identifiers passed in argument.
====

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search will optimize loading by grouping together
types that have the same `MassLoadingStrategy`,
or different strategies that are equal according to `equals()`/`hashCode()`.

When grouping types together, only one of their strategies will be called,
and will get passed a "type group" that includes all types that should be loaded.

This happens in particular when configuring the strategy on a "parent" entity type
but not on its subtypes:
the subtypes will inherit the same strategy.
====

[WARNING]
====
Be careful of non-abstract (instantiable) parent classes in inheritance trees:
when the "type group" passed to the `createIdentifierLoader` method
contains a parent type (say, `Animal`) and none of the subtypes (neither `Lion` nor `Zebra`),
then the loader really should only load identifiers of instances of the parent type,
not of its subtypes
(it should load identifiers of entities whose type is exactly `Animal`, not `Lion` nor `Zebra`).
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-search-query-loading]]
=== Entity loading in search queries

Because by default, the Standalone POJO Mapper does not know anything about where the entity data comes from,
<<search-dsl-query-generality,entity loading in search queries>>
requires plugging in a way to load entities from the other datastore.

[TIP]
====
With the Standalone POJO Mapper, if you want entities to be loaded from the index,
instead of an external datasource,
add a <<mapping-projection,projection constructor>> to your entity type.

This will automatically result in your entity being loaded from the index
when the configuration described in this section is missing and loading is required
(for example when not using `select()` in a search query).
====

This is done on <<mapper-pojo-standalone-startup,startup>>
by assigning a `SelectionLoadingStrategy` to each entity type that will require loading in search queries:

.Assigning selection loading strategies with the Standalone POJO Mapper
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/loading/StandalonePojoSelectionLoadingIT.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create a builder.
<2> Declare an entity type, and assign it a `SelectionLoadingStrategy`.
<3> Build the `SearchMapping`.
====

Once all types to search for have their selection loading strategy implemented and assigned,
they can be loaded as hits when <<search-dsl-query,querying>>:

.Loading entities as search query hits with the Standalone POJO Mapper
====

----
<1> Retrieve a reference to an implementation-specific datastore.
<2> <<entrypoints-search-mapping-mapper-pojo-standalone,Retrieve the `SearchMapping`>>.
<3> Open a connection to the datastore (this is just an imaginary API, for the purpose of this example).
Note we're using a try-with-resources block,
so that the connection will automatically be closed when we're done with it.
<4> Start creating a new session.
Note we're using a try-with-resources block,
so that the session will automatically be closed when we're done with it.
<5> Pass the connection to the new session.
<6> Build the new session.
<7> Create a <<search-dsl-query,search query>>: since we don't use `select()`,
hits will have their default representations: entities loaded from the datastore.
<8> Retrieve the search hits as entities loaded from the datastore.
====

Below is an example of `SelectionLoadingStrategy` implementation for an imaginary datastore.

.Implementing `SelectionLoadingStrategy`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/org/hibernate/search/documentation/mapper/pojo/standalone/loading/MySelectionLoadingStrategy.java[tags=include]
----
<1> Implement an entity loader to actually load entities from the identifiers returned by Lucene/Elasticsearch.
Hibernate Search will call this method multiple times for a single mass indexing,
<2> The entity loader does not own a connection, but retrieves it from the context passed to the `SearchSession`.
<3> Load the entities corresponding to the identifiers passed in argument and return them.
Returned entities **must** be in the same order as the identifiers passed in argument.
====

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate Search will optimize loading by grouping together
types that have the same `SelectionLoadingStrategy`,
or different strategies that are equal according to `equals()`/`hashCode()`.

When grouping types together, only one of their strategies will be called,
and will get passed a "type group" that includes all types that should be loaded.

This happens in particular when configuring the strategy on a "parent" entity type
but not on its subtypes:
the subtypes will inherit the same strategy.
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-coordination]]
== Coordination

The Standalone POJO Mapper does not provide any way
to coordinate between nodes at the moment,
so its behavior is roughly similar to that described in <<coordination-none>>,
except entity data extracting happens on session closing instead of happening on Hibernate ORM session flushes,
and indexing happens immediately after that instead of happening on transaction commit.

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-configuration-from-property-file]]
== Reading configuration properties from a file

The Standalone POJO Mapper `SearchMappingBuilder` can also take properties from a `Reader` compatible with `java.util.Properties#load(Reader)`:

.Loading configuration properties from a file using a `Reader`
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]

----
<1> Get a reader representing a property file with configuration properties.
<2> Start configuring the Standalone POJO Mapper.
<3> Pass the property file reader to the builder.
====

[[mapper-pojo-standalone-configuration-other]]
== Other configuration

Other configuration properties are mentioned in the relevant parts of this documentation.
You can find a full reference of available properties in
<<configuration-properties-aggregated-hibernate-search-mapper-pojo-standalone, the Standalone POJO Mapper configuration properties appendix>>.
