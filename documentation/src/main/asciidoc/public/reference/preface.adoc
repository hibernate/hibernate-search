Full text search engines like Apache Lucene are very powerful technologies to add efficient free
text search capabilities to applications. However, Lucene suffers several mismatches when dealing
with object domain models. Amongst other things indexes have to be kept up to date and mismatches
between index structure and domain model as well as query mismatches have to be avoided.

Hibernate Search addresses these shortcomings: it indexes your domain model with the help of a few
annotations, takes care of database/index synchronization and brings back regular managed objects
from free text queries.

To achieve this, Hibernate Search combines the power of
