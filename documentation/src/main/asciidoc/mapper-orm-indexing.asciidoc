// TODO explain in transaction/post transaction synchronizations, when they can be used and what they mean

// TODO explain how to configure how transactions should synchronize with the index (i.e. how they should wait for changes to propagate):
// - HSEARCH-3316 completion handler (sync/async, refresh request?, flush request?)
// - refresh_after_write setting (maybe we'll want to make that a mapper setting, forwarded to the work plan?)
// - (experts) HSEARCH-3305 explicit flush/refresh
// TODO Also link to the ES backend documentation, to a section explaining near-real-time and how to configure it
// Link to ES doc explaining near-real-time: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-concepts.html#_near_realtime_nrt
