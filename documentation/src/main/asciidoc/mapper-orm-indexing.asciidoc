= Indexing

== Configuration

The property `hibernate.search.indexing_strategy` controls how entities are indexed:

* by default, or when set to `event`, each change to an indexed entity
(persist, update, delete) through a Hibernate ORM Session/EntityManager
will automatically lead to a similar modification to the index
(see <<mapper-orm-indexing-automatic>>).
* when set to `manual`, changes to entities are ignored,
and indexing requires an explicit action (see <<mapper-orm-indexing-explicit>>).

The <<configuration-property-types,boolean property>> `hibernate.search.enable_dirty_check` controls how Hibernate Search decides to reindex a updated entity:

* by default, or when set to `true`, Hibernate Search will only trigger reindexing if the properties of the entity that changed
are actually used as a source to generate the indexable document.
* when set to `false`, Hibernate Search will trigger reindexing regardless of the entity properties that changed.

// TODO explain in transaction/post transaction synchronizations, when they can be used and what they mean

// TODO explain how to configure how transactions should synchronize with the index (i.e. how they should wait for changes to propagate):
// - HSEARCH-3316 completion handler (sync/async, refresh request?, flush request?)
// - refresh_after_write setting (maybe we'll want to make that a mapper setting, forwarded to the work plan?)
// - (experts) HSEARCH-3305 explicit flush/refresh
// TODO Also link to the ES backend documentation, to a section explaining near-real-time and how to configure it
// Link to ES doc explaining near-real-time: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-concepts.html#_near_realtime_nrt
