== Enabling the integration

The Hibernate ORM integration is enabled by default as soon as it is present in the classpath.

If for some reason you need to disable it,
set the `hibernate.search.autoregister_listeners` <<configuration-property-types,boolean property>> to `false`.

== Other configuration properties

Other configuration properties are mentioned in the relevant parts of this documentation.
You can find a full reference of available properties in the Hibernate Search javadoc:
