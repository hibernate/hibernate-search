== Configuration sources

When using Hibernate Search within Hibernate ORM,
configuration properties are retrieved from Hibernate ORM.

This means that wherever you set Hibernate ORM properties,
you can set Hibernate Search properties:

* In a `hibernate.properties` file at the root of your classpath.
* In `persistence.xml`, if you bootstrap Hibernate ORM with the JPA APIs
* In JVM system properties (`-DmyProperty=myValue` passed to the `java` command)
* In the configuration file of your framework,
for example `application.yaml`/`application.properties` for Spring Boot.

[[configuration-structure]]
== Structure of configuration properties

Configuration properties are all grouped under a common root.
In the ORM integration, this root is `hibernate.search`,
but other integrations (Infinispan, ...) may use a different one.
This documentation will use `hibernate.search` in all examples.

Under that root, we can distinguish between four categories of properties.

Global properties::
These properties potentially affect all Hibernate Search.
They are generally located just under the `hibernate.search` root.
+
Notable properties:

* `hibernate.search.default_backend`: defines the name of the backend used by default on all indexes.

+
Other global properties are explained in the relevant parts of this documentation:

* <<mapper-orm-configuration,Hibernate ORM integration>>

Backend properties::
These properties affect a single backend.
They are grouped under a common root that includes the backend name: `hibernate.search.backends.<backend name>`.
The backend name is arbitrarily defined by the user: just pick a string, such as `myBackend` or `elasticsearch`,
and make sure to use it consistently.
+
Notable properties:

* `hibernate.search.backends.<backend name>.type`: the type of the backend.
Set this to either `lucene` or `elasticsearch`.

+
Other backend properties are explained in the relevant parts of this documentation:

* <<backend-lucene-configuration,Lucene backend>>
* <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration,Elasticsearch backend>>

Index properties::
These properties affect either one or multiple indexes, depending on the root.
+
With the root `hibernate.search.backends.<backend name>.index_defaults`,
they set defaults for all indexes of the referenced backend.
The backend name must match the name defined in the mapping.
+
With the root `hibernate.search.backends.<backend name>.indexes.<index name>`,
they set the value for a specific index, overriding the defaults (if any).
The backend and index names must match the names defined in the mapping.
For ORM entities, the default index name is the name of the indexed class, without the package:
`org.mycompany.Book` will have `Book` as its default index name.
Index names can be customized in the mapping.

+
Examples:

* `hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.index_defaults.lifecycle.strategy = validate`
sets the `lifecycle.strategy` property for all indexes of the backend `myBackend`.
* `hibernate.search.backends.myBackend.indexes.Product.lifecycle.strategy = none`
sets the `lifecycle.strategy` property for the `Product` index of the backend `myBackend`.

+
Other index properties are explained in the relevant parts of this documentation:

* <<backend-lucene-configuration,Lucene backend>>
* <<backend-elasticsearch-configuration,Elasticsearch backend>>

[[configuration-property-types]]
== Type of configuration properties

Property values can be set programmatically as Java objects,
or through a configuration file as a string that will have to be parsed.

Each configuration property in Hibernate Search has an assigned type,
and this type defines the accepted values in both cases.

Here are the definitions of all property types.

[cols="h,2*", options="header"]
|===============
|Designation|Accepted Java objects|Accepted String format
|String|`java.lang.String`|Any string
|Boolean|`java.lang.Boolean`|`true` or `false` (case-insensitive)
|Integer|`java.lang.Number` (will call .intValue())|Any string that can be parsed by `Integer.parseInt`
|Long|`java.lang.Number` (will call .longValue())|Any string that can be parsed by `Long.parseLong`

|Bean reference of type T
|An instance of `T`
or `org.hibernate.search.engine.environment.bean.BeanReference`
or a reference by type as a `java.lang.Class`
(see <<configuration-bean-resolution>>)
|A reference by name as a `java.lang.String`
(this can be a fully-qualified class name, see <<configuration-bean-resolution>>)

|Multi-valued bean reference of type T
|A `java.util.Collection` containing bean references (see above)
|Whitespace separated string containing bean references (see above)
|===============

[[configuration-property-tracking]]
== Configuration property tracking

When using the ORM integration,
Hibernate Search will track the parts of the provided configuration that are actually used
and will log a warning if any configuration property is never used,
because that might indicate a configuration issue.

To disable this warning, set the `hibernate.search.enable_configuration_property_tracking`
<<configuration-property-types,boolean property>> to `false`.

[[configuration-bean-resolution]]
== Bean resolution

Hibernate Search allows to plug in references to custom beans in various places:
configuration properties, mapping annotations, arguments to APIs, ...

Everywhere a custom bean reference is expected, three types of references are accepted:

* A reference by type, as a `java.lang.Class`.
* A reference by name, as a `java.lang.String`.
* A reference by type *and* name (through a `BeanReference`, see below).

Bean resolution (i.e. the process of turning this reference into an object instance) happens as follows:

* If a dependency injection framework is integrated into Hibernate ORM,
the reference is first requested to the DI framework.
Currently CDI and recent versions of Spring are supported.
* Otherwise, or if the DI framework cannot find a matching bean definition,
reflection is used to resolve the bean.
References by name are turned into a reference by type by interpreting the bean name
as the fully-qualified class name
Reference by type are resolved by calling the public, no-argument constructor of the given type.
References by type *and* name are resolved as a reference by name,
then the resulting object is checked to be an instance of the given type.

[TIP]
====
For experienced users, Hibernate Search also provides the `org.hibernate.search.engine.environment.bean.BeanReference` type,
which is accepted in configuration properties and APIs.
This interface allows to plug in custom instantiation and cleanup code.
See the javadoc of this interface for details.
