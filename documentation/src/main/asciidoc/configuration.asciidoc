NOTE: We will need to re-organize the documentation about configuration.
Main problems:

* Property keys are specific to the mapper: in ORM they start with hibernate.search.,
but not in Infinispan. I guess we could just use the ORM keys and live with this.
* The source used for configuration properties is specific to the mapper
* In this section we used to document configuration properties that are completely specific to ORM,
or completely specific to Lucene. Maybe move that to the specific sections for ORM and Lucene?
* Yet some configuration principles are relevant for every mapper/backend, such as the hibernate.search.indexes.my_index
hibernate.search.backends.my_backend property structure.
