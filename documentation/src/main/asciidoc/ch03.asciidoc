[[search-configuration-event]]
=== Enabling Hibernate Search and automatic indexing

Let's start with the most basic configuration question - how do I enable Hibernate Search?


==== Enabling Hibernate Search

The good news is that Hibernate Search is enabled out of the box when detected on the classpath by
Hibernate Core. If, for some reason you need to disable it, set
+$$hibernate.search.autoregister_listeners$$+ to false. Note that there is no performance penalty
when the listeners are enabled but no entities are annotated as indexed.


==== Automatic indexing

By default, every time an object is inserted, updated or deleted through Hibernate, Hibernate Search
updates the according Lucene index. It is sometimes desirable to disable that features if either
your index is read-only or if index updates are done in a batch way (see <<search-batchindex>>).

To disable event based indexing, set
====
[source]
----
hibernate.search.indexing_strategy = manual
----
====


[NOTE]
====
In most case, the JMS backend provides the best of both world, a lightweight event based system
keeps track of all changes in the system, and the heavyweight indexing process is done by a separate
process or machine.
====


[[configuration-indexmanager]]

=== Configuring the IndexManager

The role of the index manager component is described in <<search-architecture>>. Hibernate Search
provides two possible implementations for this interface to choose from.


* ++directory-based++: the default implementation which uses the Lucene Directory abstraction to
manage index files.
* ++near-real-time++: avoid flushing writes to disk at each commit. This index manager is also
Directory based, but also makes uses of Lucene's NRT functionality.

To select an alternative you specify the property:
====
[source]
----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].indexmanager = near-real-time
----
====

==== +directory-based+

The default IndexManager implementation. This is the one mostly referred to in this documentation.
It is highly configurable and allows you to select different settings for the reader strategy, back
ends and directory providers. Refer to <<search-configuration-directory>>, <<configuration-worker>>
and <<configuration-reader-strategy>> for more details.


==== +near-real-time+

The NRTIndexManager is an extension of the default IndexManager, leveraging the Lucene NRT (Near
Real Time) features for extreme low latency index writes. As a trade-off it requires a non-clustered
and non-shared index. In other words, it will ignore configuration settings for alternative back
ends other than +lucene+ and will acquire exclusive write locks on the Directory.

To achieve this low latency writes, the IndexWriter will not flush every change to disk. Queries
will be allowed to read updated state from the unflushed index writer buffers; the downside of this
strategy is that if the application crashes or the IndexWriter is otherwise killed you'll have to
rebuild the indexes as some updates might be lost.

Because of these downsides, and because a master node in cluster can be configured for good
performance as well, the NRT configuration is only recommended for non clustered websites with a
limited amount of data.


==== Custom

It is also possible to configure a custom IndexManager implementation by specifying the fully
qualified class name of your custom implementation. This implementation must have a no-argument
constructor:

----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].indexmanager = my.corp.myapp.CustomIndexManager
----

[TIP]
====
Your custom index manager implementation doesn't need to use the same components as the default
implementations. For example, you can delegate to a remote indexing service which doesn't expose a
Directory interface.
====


[[search-configuration-directory]]
=== Directory configuration

As we have seen in <<configuration-indexmanager>> the default index manager uses Lucene's notion of
a Directory to store the index files. The Directory implementation can be customized and Lucene
comes bundled with a file system and an in-memory implementation. DirectoryProvider is the Hibernate
Search abstraction around a Lucene Directory and handles the configuration and the initialization of
the underlying Lucene resources. <<directory-provider-table>> shows the list of the directory
providers available in Hibernate Search together with their corresponding options.

To configure your DirectoryProvider you have to understand that each indexed entity is associated to
a Lucene index (except of the case where multiple entities share the same index -
<<section-sharing-indexes>>). The name of the index is given by the index property of the @Indexed
annotation. If the index property is not specified the fully qualified name of the indexed class
will be used as name (recommended).

Knowing the index name, you can configure the directory provider and any additional options by using
the prefix hibernate.search._++<indexname>++_. The name default (hibernate.search.default) is
reserved and can be used to define properties which apply to all indexes.
<<example-configuring-directory-providers>> shows how hibernate.search.default.directory_provider
is used to set the default directory provider to be the filesystem one. hibernate.search.default.indexBase
sets then the default base directory for the indexes. As a result the index for the entity Status is
created in __/usr/lucene/indexes/org.hibernate.example.Status__.

The index for the Rule entity, however, is using an in-memory directory, because the default
directory provider for this entity is overridden by the property
hibernate.search.Rules.directory_provider.

Finally the Action entity uses a custom directory provider CustomDirectoryProvider specified via
hibernate.search.Actions.directory_provider.

.Specifying the index name
====
[source, JAVA]
----
package org.hibernate.example;

@Indexed
public class Status { ... }

@Indexed(index="Rules")
public class Rule { ... }

@Indexed(index="Actions")
public class Action { ... }
----

====
[[example-configuring-directory-providers]]
.Configuring directory providers

====
----
hibernate.search.default.directory_provider = filesystem
hibernate.search.default.indexBase = /usr/lucene/indexes
hibernate.search.Rules.directory_provider = ram
hibernate.search.Actions.directory_provider = com.acme.hibernate.CustomDirectoryProvider
----

====

[TIP]
====
Using the described configuration scheme you can easily define common rules like the directory
provider and base directory, and override those defaults later on on a per index basis.

[[directory-provider-table]]
.List of built-in DirectoryProvider
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===============
|Name and description
|Properties

|ram: Memory based directory.

The directory will be uniquely identified (in the same deployment unit) by the +@Indexed.index+ element
|none

|filesystem: File system based directory.

The directory used will be <indexBase>/<indexName>
|+indexBase+ : base directory +
+indexName+: override @Indexed.index (useful for sharded indexes) +
+locking_strategy+ : optional, see <<search-configuration-directory-lockfactories>> +
+filesystem_access_type+: allows to determine the exact type of FSDirectory implementation used
by this DirectoryProvider. Allowed values are +auto+ (the default value, selects NIOFSDirectory on
non Windows systems, SimpleFSDirectory on Windows), +simple+ (SimpleFSDirectory),
++nio++ (NIOFSDirectory), ++mmap++ (MMapDirectory). Make sure to refer to Javadocs of these Directory
implementations before changing this setting. Even though NIOFSDirectory or MMapDirectory can bring
substantial performace boosts they also have their issues.

|filesystem-master: File system based directory.

Like +filesystem+. It also copies the index to a source directory (aka copy directory) on a regular
basis.

The recommended value for the refresh period is (at least) 50% higher that the time to copy the
information (default 3600 seconds - 60 minutes).

Note that the copy is based on an incremental copy mechanism reducing the average copy time.

DirectoryProvider typically used on the master node in a JMS back end cluster.

The +buffer_size_on_copy+ optimum depends on your operating system and available RAM; most
people reported good results using values between 16 and 64MB.
|+indexBase+: base directory +
+indexName+: override @Indexed.index (useful for sharded indexes) +
+sourceBase+: source (copy) base directory. +
+source+: source directory suffix (default to ++@Indexed.index++). The actual source directory name
being _<sourceBase>/<source>_ +
+refresh+: refresh period in seconds (the copy will take place every refresh seconds). If a copy
is still in progress when the following refresh period elapses, the second copy operation will be
skipped. +
+buffer_size_on_copy+: The amount of MegaBytes to move in a single low level copy instruction;
defaults to 16MB. +
+locking_strategy+ : optional, see <<search-configuration-directory-lockfactories>> +
+filesystem_access_type+: allows to determine the exact type of FSDirectory implementation used by
this DirectoryProvider. Allowed values are +auto+ (the default value, selects NIOFSDirectory on non
Windows systems, SimpleFSDirectory on Windows), +simple+ (SimpleFSDirectory),
++nio++ (NIOFSDirectory), ++mmap++ (MMapDirectory). Make sure to refer to Javadocs of these
Directory implementations before changing this setting. Even though NIOFSDirectory or MMapDirectory
can bring substantial performace boosts they also have their issues.

|filesystem-slave: File system based directory.

Like +filesystem+, but retrieves a master version
(source) on a regular basis. To avoid locking and inconsistent search results, 2 local copies are kept.

The recommended value for the refresh period is (at least) 50% higher that the time to copy the
information (default 3600 seconds - 60 minutes).

Note that the copy is based on an incremental copy mechanism reducing the average copy time.
If a copy is still in progress when refresh period elapses, the second copy operation will be skipped.

DirectoryProvider typically used on slave nodes using a JMS back end.

The +buffer_size_on_copy+ optimum depends on your operating system and available RAM; most
people reported good results using values between 16 and 64MB.

|+indexBase+: Base directory +
+indexName+: override @Indexed.index (useful for sharded indexes) +
+sourceBase+: Source (copy) base directory. +
+source+: Source directory suffix (default to ++@Indexed.index++). The actual source directory
name being _<sourceBase>/<source>_ +
+refresh+: refresh period in second (the copy will take place every refresh seconds). +
+buffer_size_on_copy+: The amount of MegaBytes to move in a single low level copy instruction;
defaults to 16MB. +
+locking_strategy+ : optional, see <<search-configuration-directory-lockfactories>> +
+retry_marker_lookup+ : optional, default to 0. Defines how many times we look for the marker files
in the source directory before failing. Waiting 5 seconds between each try. +
+retry_initialize_period+ : optional, set an integer value in seconds to enable the retry initialize
feature: if the slave can't find the master index it will try again until it's found in background,
without preventing the application to start: fullText queries performed before the index is
initialized are not blocked but will return empty results. When not enabling the option or
explicitly setting it to zero it will fail with an exception instead of scheduling a retry timer.
To prevent the application from starting without an invalid index but still control an
initialization timeout, see +retry_marker_lookup+ instead. +
+filesystem_access_type+: allows to determine the exact type of FSDirectory implementation
used by this DirectoryProvider. Allowed values are +auto+ (the default value, selects NIOFSDirectory
on non Windows systems, SimpleFSDirectory on Windows), +simple+ (SimpleFSDirectory), ++nio++
(NIOFSDirectory), ++mmap++ (MMapDirectory). Make sure to refer to Javadocs of these Directory
implementations before changing this setting. Even though NIOFSDirectory or MMapDirectory can bring
substantial performace boosts they also have their issues.

|infinispan: Infinispan based directory.

Use it to store the index in a distributed grid, making
index changes visible to all elements of the cluster very quickly. Also see
<<infinispan-directories>> for additional requirements and configuration settings.
Infinispan needs a global configuration and additional dependencies; the
settings defined here apply to each different index.
|+locking_cachename+: name of the Infinispan cache to use to store locks. +
+data_cachename+ : name of the Infinispan cache to use to store the largest data chunks; this area
will contain the largest objects, use replication if you have enough memory or switch to
distribution. +
+metadata_cachename+: name of the Infinispan cache to use to store the metadata relating to the
index; this data is rather small and read very often, it's recommended to have this cache setup
using replication. +
+chunk_size+: large files of the index are split in smaller chunks, you might want to set the
highest value efficiently handled by your network. Networking tuning might be useful.

|===============

[TIP]
====
If the built-in directory providers do not fit your needs, you can write your own directory provider
by implementing the org.hibernate.store.DirectoryProvider interface. In this case, pass the fully
qualified class name of your provider into the +$$directory_provider$$+ property. You can pass any
additional properties using the prefix hibernate.search._++<indexname>++_.
====


[[infinispan-directories]]
==== Infinispan Directory configuration

Infinispan is a distributed, scalable, highly available data grid platform which supports
auto-discovery of peer nodes. Using Infinispan and Hibernate Search in combination, it is possible to
store the Lucene index in a distributed environment where index updates are quickly available on all
nodes.

This section describes in greater detail how to configure Hibernate Search to use an Infinispan
Lucene Directory.

When using an Infinispan Directory the index is stored in memory and shared across multiple nodes.
It is considered a single directory distributed across all participating nodes. If a node updates
the index, all other nodes are updated as well. Updates on one node can be immediately searched for
in the whole cluster.

The default configuration replicates all data defining the index across all nodes, thus consuming a
significant amount of memory. For large indexes it's suggested to enable data distribution, so that
each piece of information is replicated to a subset of all cluster members.

It is also possible to offload part or most information to a +CacheStore+, such as plain filesystem,
Amazon S3, Cassandra, Berkley DB or standard relational databases. You can configure it to have a
+CacheStore+ on each node or have a single centralized one shared by each node.

See the link:$$http://infinispan.org/documentation/$$[ Infinispan documentation] for all Infinispan
configuration options.


===== Requirements

To use the Infinispan directory via Maven, add the following dependencies:

.Maven dependencies for Hibernate Search

====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search</artifactId>
   <version>WORKING</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-search-infinispan</artifactId>
   <version>{hibernateSearchVersion}</version>
</dependency>
----
====

For the non-maven users, add +hibernate-search-infinispan.jar+, +infinispan-lucene-directory.jar+
and +infinispan-core.jar+ to your application classpath. These last two jars are distributed by
link:$$http://infinispan.org/download/$$[Infinispan].


===== Architecture

Even when using an Infinispan directory it's still recommended to use the JMS Master/Slave or
JGroups backend, because in Infinispan all nodes will share the same index and it is likely that
IndexWriters being active on different nodes will try to acquire the lock on the same index. So
instead of sending updates directly to the index, send it to a JMS queue or JGroups channel and have
a single node apply all changes on behalf of all other nodes.

Configuring a non-default backend is not a requirement but a performance optimization as locks are
enabled to have a single node writing.

To configure a JMS slave only the backend must be replaced, the directory provider must be set to
++infinispan++; set the same directory provider on the master, they will connect without the need to
setup the copy job across nodes. Using the JGroups backend is very similar - just combine the
backend configuration with the +infinispan+ directory provider.


===== Infinispan Configuration

The most simple configuration only requires to enable the backend:

====
[source]
----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].directory_provider = infinispan
----
====

That's all what is needed to get a cluster-replicated index, but the default configuration does not
enable any form of permanent persistence for the index; to enable such a feature an Infinispan
configuration file should be provided.

To use Infinispan, Hibernate Search requires a CacheManager; it can lookup and reuse an existing
CacheManager, via JNDI, or start and manage a new one. In the latter case Hibernate Search will
start and stop it ( closing occurs when the Hibernate SessionFactory is closed).

To use and existing CacheManager via JNDI (optional parameter):


====
[source]
----
hibernate.search.infinispan.cachemanager_jndiname = [jndiname]
----
====

To start a new CacheManager from a configuration file (optional parameter):

====
[source]
----
hibernate.search.infinispan.configuration_resourcename = [infinispan configuration filename]
----
====

If both parameters are defined, JNDI will have priority. If none of these is defined, Hibernate
Search will use the default Infinispan configuration included in +hibernate-search-infinispan.jar+.
This configuration should work fine in most cases but does not store the index in a persistent cache
store.

As mentioned in <<directory-provider-table>>, each index makes use of three caches, so three
different caches should be configured as shown in the +default-hibernatesearch-infinispan.xml+
provided in the +hibernate-search-infinispan.jar+. Several indexes can share the same caches.

Infinispan relies on JGroups for its networking functionality, so unless you are using Infinispan on
a single node, an Infinispan configuration file will refer to a JGroups configuration file. This
coupling is not always practical and we provide a property to override the used JGroups
configuration file:

====
[source]
----
hibernate.search.infinispan.configuration.transport_override_resourcename = jgroups-ec2.xml
----
====

This allows to just switch the JGroups configuration while keeping the rest of the Infinispan
configuration.

The file +jgroups-ec2.xml+ used in the example above is one of the several JGroups configurations
included in Infinispan. It is a good starting point to run on Amazon EC2 networks. For more details
and examples see link:$$http://infinispan.org/docs/7.0.x/user_guide/user_guide.html#_use_one_of_the_
pre_configured_jgroups_files$$[ usage of pre-configured JGroups stacks] in the Infinispan
configuration guide.

[[configuration-worker]]
=== Worker configuration

It is possible to refine how Hibernate Search interacts with Lucene through the worker
configuration. There exist several architectural components and possible extension points. Let's
have a closer look.

First there is a Worker. An implementation of the Worker interface is responsible for receiving all
entity changes, queuing them by context and applying them once a context ends. The most intuitive
context, especially in connection with ORM, is the transaction. For this reason Hibernate Search
will per default use the TransactionalWorker to scope all changes per transaction. One can, however,
imagine a scenario where the context depends for example on the number of entity changes or some
other application (lifecycle) events. For this reason the Worker implementation is configurable as
shown in <<table-worker-configuration>>.

[[table-worker-configuration]]
.Scope configuration

|===============
|*Property*|*Description*
|hibernate.search.default.worker.scope|The fully qualified class name of the
            Worker implementation to use. If this
            property is not set, empty or +transaction+ the
            default TransactionalWorker is
            used.
|hibernate.search.default.worker.*|All configuration properties prefixed with
            +hibernate.search.default.worker+ are passed to the
            Worker during initialization. This allows adding custom, worker
            specific parameters.

|===============

Once a context ends it is time to prepare and apply the index changes. This can be done
synchronously or asynchronously from within a new thread. Synchronous updates have the advantage
that the index is at all times in sync with the databases. Asynchronous updates, on the other hand,
can help to minimize the user response time. The drawback is potential discrepancies between
database and index states. Lets look at the configuration options shown in 
<<table-work-execution-configuration>>.

[NOTE]
====
The following options can be different on each index; in fact they need the indexName prefix or use
+default+ to set the default value for all indexes.
====

[[table-work-execution-configuration]]
.Execution configuration
|===============
|*Property*|*Description*
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.execution|++sync++: synchronous execution (default)

++async++: asynchronous execution
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.thread_pool.size|The backend can apply updates from the same transaction
            context (or batch) in parallel, using a threadpool. The default
            value is 1. You can experiment with larger values if you have many
            operations per transaction.
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.buffer_queue.max|Defines the maximal number of work queue if the thread poll
            is starved. Useful only for asynchronous execution. Default to
            infinite. If the limit is reached, the work is done by the main
            thread.

|===============


So far all work is done within the same Virtual Machine (VM), no matter which execution mode. The
total amount of work has not changed for the single VM. Luckily there is a better approach, namely
delegation. It is possible to send the indexing work to a different server by configuring
hibernate.search.default.worker.backend - see <<table-backend-configuration>>. Again this option can be
configured differently for each index.

[[table-backend-configuration]]
.Backend configuration

|===============
|*Property*|*Description*
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.backend|++lucene++: The default backend which runs index updates in the same VM. Also used when the property is undefined or empty.

++jms++: JMS backend. Index updates are send to a JMS queue to be processed by an indexing master. See <<table-jms-backend-configuration>> for additional configuration options and <<jms-backend>> for a more detailed description of this setup.

+jgroupsMaster+, +jgroupsSlave+ or ++jgroups++: Backend using link:$$http://www.jgroups.org/$$[JGroups] as communication layer. See <<jgroups-backend>> for a more detailed description of this setup.

++blackhole++: Mainly a test/developer setting which ignores all indexing work

You can also specify the fully qualified name of a class implementing BackendQueueProcessor. This way you can implement your own communication layer. The implementation is responsible for returning a Runnable instance which on execution will process the index work.

|===============


[[table-jms-backend-configuration]]
.JMS backend configuration

|===============
|*Property*|*Description*
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.jndi.*|Defines the JNDI properties to initiate the InitialContext
            (if needed). JNDI is only used by the JMS back end.
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.jms.connection_factory|Mandatory for the JMS back end. Defines the JNDI name to
            lookup the JMS connection factory from
            (++/ConnectionFactory++ by default in JBoss
            AS)
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.jms.queue|Mandatory for the JMS back end. Defines the JNDI name to
            lookup the JMS queue from. The queue will be used to post work
            messages.
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.jms.login|Optional for the JMS slaves. Use it when your queue
            requires login credentials to define your login.
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.​worker.jms.login|Optional for the JMS slaves. Use it when your queue
            requires login credentials to define your password.

|===============



[WARNING]
====
As you probably noticed, some of the shown properties are correlated which means that not all
combinations of property values make sense. In fact you can end up with a non-functional
configuration. This is especially true for the case that you provide your own implementations of
some of the shown interfaces. Make sure to study the existing code before you write your own Worker
or BackendQueueProcessor implementation.
====


[[jms-backend]]
==== JMS Master/Slave back end

This section describes in greater detail how to configure the Master/Slave Hibernate Search
architecture.

JMS back end configuration.



===== Slave nodes

Every index update operation is sent to a JMS queue. Index querying operations are executed on a
local index copy.

.JMS Slave configuration

====
----
### slave configuration

## DirectoryProvider
# (remote) master location
hibernate.search.default.sourceBase = /mnt/mastervolume/lucenedirs/mastercopy

# local copy location
hibernate.search.default.indexBase = /Users/prod/lucenedirs

# refresh every half hour
hibernate.search.default.refresh = 1800

# appropriate directory provider
hibernate.search.default.directory_provider = filesystem-slave

## Backend configuration
hibernate.search.default.worker.backend = jms
hibernate.search.default.worker.jms.connection_factory = /ConnectionFactory
hibernate.search.default.worker.jms.queue = queue/hibernatesearch
#optionally authentication credentials:
hibernate.search.default.worker.jms.login = myname
hibernate.search.default.worker.jms.password = wonttellyou
#optional jndi configuration (check your JMS provider for more information)

## Optional asynchronous execution strategy
# hibernate.search.default.worker.execution = async
# hibernate.search.default.worker.thread_pool.size = 2
# hibernate.search.default.worker.buffer_queue.max = 50
----
====

[TIP]
====
A file system local copy is recommended for faster search results.
====




===== Master node

Every index update operation is taken from a JMS queue and executed. The master index is copied on a
regular basis.

.JMS Master configuration

====
----
### master configuration

## DirectoryProvider
# (remote) master location where information is copied to
hibernate.search.default.sourceBase = /mnt/mastervolume/lucenedirs/mastercopy

# local master location
hibernate.search.default.indexBase = /Users/prod/lucenedirs

# refresh every half hour
hibernate.search.default.refresh = 1800

# appropriate directory provider
hibernate.search.default.directory_provider = filesystem-master

## Backend configuration
#Backend is the default lucene one
----
====

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that the refresh period be higher than the expected copy time; if a copy operation
is still being performed when the next refresh triggers, the second refresh is skipped: it's safe to
set this value low even when the copy time is not known.
====


In addition to the Hibernate Search framework configuration, a Message Driven Bean has to be written
and set up to process the index works queue through JMS.

.Message Driven Bean processing the indexing queue
====
[source, JAVA]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
      @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="destinationType",
                                propertyValue="javax.jms.Queue"),
      @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName="destination",
                                propertyValue="queue/hibernatesearch")
   } )
public class MDBSearchController extends AbstractJMSHibernateSearchController
                                 implements MessageListener {

    @PersistenceContext EntityManager em;

    @Override
    protected SearchFactory getSearchFactory() {
        FullTextEntityManager fullTextEntityManager = Search.getFullTextEntityManager(em);
        return fullTextEntityManager.getSearchFactory();
    }
}
----

====

This example inherits from the abstract JMS controller class available in the Hibernate Search
source code and implements a JavaEE MDB. This implementation is given as an example and can be
adjusted to make use of non Java EE Message Driven Beans.
Essentially what you need to do is to connect the specific JMS Queue with the +SearchFactory+
instance of the EntityManager.
As an advanced alternative, you can implement your own logic by not extending +AbstractJMSHibernateSearchController+
but rather to use it as an implementation example.

[[jgroups-backend]]
==== JGroups Master/Slave back end

This section describes how to configure the JGroups Master/Slave back end. The master and slave
roles are similar to what is illustrated in <<jms-backend>>, only a different backend
(hibernate.search.default.worker.backend) needs to be set.

A specific backend can be configured to act either as a slave using +jgroupsSlave+, as a master
using +jgroupsMaster+, or can automatically switch between the roles as needed by using +jgroups+.


[NOTE]
====
Either you specify a single +jgroupsMaster+ and a set of +jgroupsSlave+ instances, or you specify
all instances as +jgroups+. Never mix the two approaches!
====

All backends configured to use JGroups share the same channel. The JGroups JChannel is the main
communication link across all nodes participating in the same cluster group; since it is convenient
to have just one channel shared across all backends, the Channel configuration properties are not
defined on a per-worker section but are defined globally. See <<jgroups-channel-configuration>>.

Table <<table-jgroups-backend-configuration>> contains all configuration options which can be set
independently on each index backend. These apply to all three variants of the backend:
+jgroupsSlave+, +jgroupsMaster+, +jgroups+. It is very unlikely that you need to change any of these
from their defaults.

[[table-jgroups-backend-configuration]]
.JGroups backend configuration properties

|===============
|*Property*|*Description*
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.jgroups.block_waiting_ack|Set to either +true+ or
              +false+. False is more efficient but will not
              wait for the operation to be delivered to the peers. Defaults to
              +true+ when the backend is synchronous, to
              +false+ when the backend is
              +async+.
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.jgroups.​messages_timeout|The timeout of waiting for a single command to be
              acknowledged and executed when
              +$$block_waiting_ack$$+ is +true+,
              or just acknowledged otherwise. Value in milliseconds, defaults
              to +20000+.
|hibernate.search.<indexName>.jgroups.delegate_backend|The master node receiving indexing operations forwards
              them to a standard backend to be performed. Defaults to
              +lucene+. See also <<table-backend-configuration>> for other options, but
              probably the only useful option is +blackhole+,
              or a custom implementation, to help isolating network latency
              problems.

|===============


===== Slave nodes

Every index update operation is sent through a JGroups channel to the master node. Index querying
operations are executed on a local index copy. Enabling the JGroups worker only makes sure the index
operations are sent to the master, you still have to synchronize configuring an appropriate
directory (See +filesystem-master+, +filesystem-slave+ or +infinispan+ options in 
<<search-configuration-directory>>).

.JGroups Slave configuration
====
----
### slave configuration
hibernate.search.default.worker.backend = jgroupsSlave
----
====


===== Master node

Every index update operation is taken from a JGroups channel and executed. The master index is
copied on a regular basis.

.JGroups Master configuration
====
----
### master configuration
hibernate.search.default.worker.backend = jgroupsMaster
----

====


===== Automatic master election


[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is considered experimental. In particular during a re-election process there is a small
window of time in which indexing requests could be lost.
====

In this mode the different nodes will autonomously elect a master node. When a master fails, a new
node is elected automatically.

When setting this backend it is expected that all Hibernate Search instances in the same cluster use
the same backend for each specific index: this configuration is an alternative to the static
+jgroupsMaster+ and +jgroupsSlave+ approach so make sure to not mix them.

To synchronize the indexes in this configuration avoid +filesystem-master+ and +filesystem-slave+
directory providers as their behaviour can not be switched dynamically; use the Infinispan
+Directory+ instead, which has no need for different configurations on each instance and allows
dynamic switching of writers; see also <<infinispan-directories>>.

.JGroups configuration for automatic master configuration
====
----
### automatic configuration
hibernate.search.default.worker.backend = jgroups
----

====

[TIP]
====
Should you use +jgroups+ or the couple +jgroupsMaster+, ++jgroupsSlave++?

The dynamic +jgroups+ backend is better suited for environments in which your master is more likely
to need to failover to a different machine, as in clouds. The static configuration has the benefit
of keeping the master at a well known location: your architecture might take advantage of it by
sending most write requests to the known master. Also optimisation and MassIndexer operations need
to be triggered on the master node.
====


[[jgroups-channel-configuration]]
===== JGroups channel configuration

Configuring the JGroups channel essentially entails specifying the transport in terms of a network
protocol stack. To configure the JGroups transport, point the configuration property
hibernate.search.services.jgroups.configurationFile to a JGroups configuration file; this can be
either a file path or a Java resource name.


[TIP]
====
If no property is explicitly specified it is assumed that the JGroups default configuration file
+flush-udp.xml+ is used. This example configuration is known to work in most scenarios, with the
notable exception of Amazon AWS; refer to the
link:$$http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/$$[JGroups manual] for more examples and protocol
configuration details.
====


The default cluster name is +Hibernate Search Cluster+ which can be configured as seen in <<example-jgroups-cluster-name>>.

[[example-jgroups-cluster-name]]
.JGroups cluster name configuration
====
----
hibernate.search.services.jgroups.clusterName = My-Custom-Cluster-Id
----
====

The cluster name is what identifies a group: by changing the name you can run different clusters in
the same network in isolation.

====== JGroups channel instance injection

For programmatic configurations, one additional option is available to configure the JGroups
channel: to pass an existing channel instance to Hibernate Search directly using the property
+hibernate.search.services.jgroups.providedChannel+, as shown in the following example.

====
[source, JAVA]
----
import org.hibernate.search.backend.impl.jgroups.JGroupsChannelProvider;

org.jgroups.JChannel channel = ...
Map<String,String> properties = new HashMap<String,String)(1);
properties.put( JGroupsChannelProvider.CHANNEL_INJECT, channel );
EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory( "userPU", properties );
----
====

[[configuration-reader-strategy]]

=== Reader strategy configuration

The different reader strategies are described in <<search-architecture-readerstrategy>>. Out of the
box strategies are:


* ++shared++: share index readers across several queries. This strategy is the most efficient.
* ++not-shared++: create an index reader for each individual query

The default reader strategy is +shared+. This can be adjusted:

====
----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].reader.strategy = not-shared
----
====

Adding this property switches to the +not-shared+ strategy.

Or if you have a custom reader strategy:

====
----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].reader.strategy = my.corp.myapp.CustomReaderProvider
----
====

where my.corp.myapp.CustomReaderProvider is the custom strategy implementation.



=== Exception handling

Hibernate Search allows you to configure how exceptions are handled during the indexing process. If
no configuration is provided then exceptions are logged to the log output by default. It is possible
to explicitly declare the exception logging mechanism as seen below:

====
----
hibernate.search.error_handler = log
----
====

The default exception handling occurs for both synchronous and asynchronous indexing. Hibernate
Search provides an easy mechanism to override the default error handling implementation.

In order to provide your own implementation you must implement the ErrorHandler interface, which
provides the handle(ErrorContext context) method. ErrorContext provides a reference to the primary
LuceneWork instance, the underlying exception and any subsequent LuceneWork instances that could not
be processed due to the primary exception.


====
[source, JAVA]
----
public interface ErrorContext {
   List<LuceneWork> getFailingOperations();
   LuceneWork getOperationAtFault();
   Throwable getThrowable();
   boolean hasErrors();
}
----
====

To register this error handler with Hibernate Search you must declare the fully qualified classname
of your ErrorHandler implementation in the configuration properties:


====
----
hibernate.search.error_handler = CustomerErrorHandler
----
====

=== Lucene configuration

Even though Hibernate Search will try to shield you as much as possible from Lucene specifics, there
are several Lucene specifics which can be directly configured, either for performance reasons or for
satisfying a specific usecase. The following sections discuss these configuration options.

[[lucene-indexing-performance]]


==== Tuning indexing performance

Hibernate Search allows you to tune the Lucene indexing performance by specifying a set of
parameters which are passed through to underlying Lucene +IndexWriter+ such as +mergeFactor+,
+maxMergeDocs+ and +maxBufferedDocs+. You can specify these parameters either as default values
applying for all indexes, on a per index basis, or even per shard.

There are several low level +IndexWriter+ settings which can be tuned for different use cases. 
These parameters are grouped by the +indexwriter+ keyword:

====
----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].indexwriter.<parameter_name>
----
====

If no value is set for an +indexwriter+ value in a specific shard configuration, Hibernate Search
will look at the index section, then at the default section.[[example-performamce-option-
configuration]]

.Example performance option configuration
====
----
hibernate.search.Animals.2.indexwriter.max_merge_docs = 10
hibernate.search.Animals.2.indexwriter.merge_factor = 20
hibernate.search.Animals.2.indexwriter.term_index_interval = default
hibernate.search.default.indexwriter.max_merge_docs = 100
hibernate.search.default.indexwriter.ram_buffer_size = 64
----
====

The configuration in <<example-performamce-option-configuration>> will result in these settings
applied on the second shard of the Animal index:

* +$$max_merge_docs$$+ = 10
* +$$merge_factor$$+ = 20
* +$$ram_buffer_size$$+ = 64MB
* +$$term_index_interval$$+ = Lucene default

All other values will use the defaults defined in Lucene.

The default for all values is to leave them at Lucene's own default. The values listed in <<table-
performance-parameters>> depend for this reason on the version of Lucene you are using. The values
shown are relative to version +2.4+. For more information about Lucene indexing performance, please
refer to the Lucene documentation.

[[table-performance-parameters]]
.List of indexing performance and behavior properties
[cols="2,2,1", options="header"]
|===============
|Property
|Description
|Default Value

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​exclusive_index_use
|Set to +true+ when no other process will need to write to the same index. This will enable
Hibernate Search to work in exclusive mode on the index and improve performance when writing changes
to the index.
|+true+ (improved performance, releases locks only at shutdown)

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​max_queue_length
|Each index has a separate "pipeline" which contains the updates to be applied to the index.
When this queue is full adding more operations to the queue becomes a blocking operation. Configuring
this setting doesn't make much sense unless the +worker.execution+ is configured as +async+.
|+1000+

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.max_buffered_delete_terms
|Determines the minimal number of delete terms required before the buffered in-memory delete terms
are applied and flushed. If there are documents buffered in memory at the time, they are merged and
a new segment is created.
|Disabled (flushes by RAM usage)

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.max_buffered_docs
|Controls the amount of documents buffered in memory during indexing. The bigger the more RAM is
consumed.
|Disabled (flushes by RAM usage)

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.max_merge_docs
|Defines the largest number of documents allowed in a segment. Smaller values perform better on
frequently changing indexes, larger values provide better search performance if the index does not
change often.
|Unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE)

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.merge_factor
|Controls segment merge frequency and size. Determines how often segment indexes are merged when
insertion occurs. With smaller values, less RAM is used while indexing, and searches on unoptimized
indexes are faster, but indexing speed is slower. With larger values, more RAM is used during
indexing, and while searches on unoptimized indexes are slower, indexing is faster. Thus larger
values (> 10) are best for batch index creation, and smaller values (< 10) for indexes that are
interactively maintained. The value must not be lower than 2.
|10

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.merge_min_size
|Controls segment merge frequency and size. Segments smaller than this size (in MB) are always
considered for the next segment merge operation. +
Setting this too large might result in expensive merge operations, even tough they are less frequent.
See also +org.apache.lucene.index.LogDocMergePolicy.minMergeSize+.
|0 MB (actually ~1K)

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.merge_max_size
|Controls segment merge frequency and size. Segments larger than this size (in MB) are never merged
in bigger segments. This helps reduce memory requirements and avoids some merging operations at the
cost of optimal search speed. When optimizing an index this value is ignored. +
See also +org.apache.lucene.index.LogDocMergePolicy.maxMergeSize+.
|Unlimited

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.merge_max_optimize_size
|Controls segment merge frequency and size. Segments larger than this size (in MB) are not merged
in bigger segments even when optimizing the index (see +$$merge_max_size$$+ setting as well).
Applied to +org.apache.lucene.index.LogDocMergePolicy.maxMergeSizeForOptimize+.
|Unlimited

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.merge_calibrate_by_deletes
|Controls segment merge frequency and size. Set to +false+ to not consider deleted documents when
estimating the merge policy. Applied to +org.apache.lucene.index.LogMergePolicy.calibrateSizeByDeletes+.
|+true+

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.ram_buffer_size
|Controls the amount of RAM in MB dedicated to document buffers. When used together max_buffered_docs
a flush occurs for whichever event happens first. +
Generally for faster indexing performance it's best to flush by RAM usage instead of document count
and use as large a RAM buffer as you can.
|16 MB

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.term_index_interval
|Expert: Set the interval between indexed terms. +
Large values cause less memory to be used by IndexReader, but slow random-access to terms.
Small values cause more memory to be used by an IndexReader, and speed random-access to terms.
See Lucene documentation for more details.
|128

|hibernate.search.​enable_dirty_check
|Not all entity changes require an update of the Lucene index. If all of the updated entity
properties (dirty properties) are not indexed Hibernate Search will skip the re-indexing work.
Disable this option if you use a custom ++FieldBridge++ which need to be invoked at each update
event (even though the property for which the field bridge is configured has not changed). +
This optimization will not be applied on classes using a +@ClassBridge+ or a +@DynamicBoost+. +
Boolean parameter, use "true" or "false".
|true

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.max_thread_states
|Lucene's +IndexWriter+ can apply writes in parallel, but this property controls the limit of
parallelism. If you have many cores and contention on the internal structures of the +IndexWriter+
becomes a bottleneck you should configure an higher value, at the cost of slightly higher memory
consumption.
|8

|hibernate.search.​[default\|<indexname>].​indexwriter.infostream
|Enable low level trace information about Lucene's internal components.
Causes performance degradation, should only be used for troubleshooting purposes
|false
|===============


[TIP]
====
When your architecture permits it, always keep
+$$hibernate.search.default.exclusive_index_use=true$$+ as it greatly improves efficiency in index
writing. This is the default since Hibernate Search version 4.
====



[TIP]
====
To tune the indexing speed it might be useful to time the object loading from database in isolation
from the writes to the index. To achieve this set the +blackhole+ as worker backend and start your
indexing routines. This backend does not disable Hibernate Search: it will still generate the needed
changesets to the index, but will discard them instead of flushing them to the index. In contrast to
setting the +$$hibernate.search.indexing_strategy$$+ to +manual+, using +blackhole+ will possibly
load more data from the database. because associated entities are re-indexed as well.

----
hibernate.search.[default|<indexname>].worker.backend blackhole
----

The recommended approach is to focus first on optimizing the object loading, and then use the timings you achieve as a baseline to tune the indexing process.
====


[WARNING]
====
The +blackhole+ backend is not meant to be used in production, only as a tool to identify indexing
bottlenecks.
====


[[lucene-segment-size]]
===== Control segment size

The options +$$merge_max_size$$+, +$$merge_max_optimize_size$$+, +$$merge_calibrate_by_deletes$$+
give you control on the maximum size of the segments being created, but you need to understand how
they affect file sizes. If you need to hard limit the size, consider that merging a segment is about
adding it together with another existing segment to form a larger one, so you might want to set the
+$$max_size$$+ for merge operations to less than half of your hard limit. Also segments might
initially be generated larger than your expected size at first creation time: before they are ever
merged. A segment is never created much larger than +$$ram_buffer_size$$+, but the threshold is
checked as an estimate.

Example:

====
----
//to be fairly confident no files grow above 15MB, use:
hibernate.search.default.indexwriter.ram_buffer_size = 10
hibernate.search.default.indexwriter.merge_max_optimize_size = 7
hibernate.search.default.indexwriter.merge_max_size = 7
----
====


[TIP]
====
When using the Infinispan Directory to cluster indexes make sure that your segments are smaller than
the +$$chunk_size$$+ so that you avoid fragmenting segments in the grid. Note that the
+$$chunk_size$$+ of the Infinispan Directory is expressed in bytes, while the index tuning options
are in MB.
====


[[search-configuration-directory-lockfactories]]
==== LockFactory configuration

Lucene Directorys have default locking strategies which work generally good enough for most cases,
but it's possible to specify for each index managed by Hibernate Search a specific LockingFactory
you want to use. This is generally not needed but could be useful.

Some of these locking strategies require a filesystem level lock and may be used even on RAM based
indexes, this combination is valid but in this case the +indexBase+ configuration option usually
needed only for filesystem based Directory instances must be specified to point to a filesystem
location where to store the lock marker files.

To select a locking factory, set the +$$hibernate.search.<index>.locking_strategy$$+ option to
one of +simple+, +native+, +single+ or +none+. Alternatively set it to the fully qualified name of
an implementation of +org.hibernate.search.store.LockFactoryProvider+.

[[search-configuration-directory-lockfactories-table]]
.List of available LockFactory implementations
[options="header"]
|===============
|name|Class|Description
|simple|org.apache.lucene.store.​SimpleFSLockFactory|Safe implementation based on Java's File API, it marks the usage of the index by creating a marker file.

If for some reason you had to kill your application, you will need to remove this file before restarting it.
|native|org.apache.lucene.store.​NativeFSLockFactory|As does +simple+ this also marks the usage of the index by creating a marker file, but this one is using native OS file locks so that even if the JVM is terminated the locks will be cleaned up.

This implementation has known problems on NFS, avoid it on network shares.

+native+ is the default implementation for the +filesystem+, +filesystem-master+ and +filesystem-slave+ directory providers.
|single|org.apache.lucene.store.​SingleInstanceLockFactory|This LockFactory doesn't use a file marker but is a Java object lock held in memory; therefore it's possible to use it only when you are sure the index is not going to be shared by any other process.

This is the default implementation for the +ram+ directory provider.
|none|org.apache.lucene.store.​NoLockFactory|All changes to this index are not coordinated by any lock; test your application carefully and make sure you know what it means.

|===============


Configuration example:

====
----
hibernate.search.default.locking_strategy = simple
hibernate.search.Animals.locking_strategy = native
hibernate.search.Books.locking_strategy = org.custom.components.MyLockingFactory
----
====

The Infinispan Directory uses a custom implementation; it's still possible to override it but make
sure you understand how that will work, especially with clustered indexes.



==== Index format compatibility

While Hibernate Search strives to offer a backwards compatible API making it easy to port your
application to newer versions, it still delegates to Apache Lucene to handle the index writing and
searching. This creates a dependency to the Lucene index format. The Lucene developers of course
attempt to keep a stable index format, but sometimes a change in the format can not be avoided. In
those cases you either have to re-index all your data or use an index upgrade tool. Sometimes Lucene
is also able to read the old format so you don't need to take specific actions (besides making
backup of your index).

While an index format incompatibility is a rare event, it can happen more often that Lucene's
Analyzer implementations might slightly change its behavior. This can lead to a poor recall score,
possibly missing many hits from the results.

Hibernate Search exposes a configuration property +$$hibernate.search.lucene_version$$+ which
instructs the analyzers and other Lucene classes to conform to their behavior as defined in an
(older) specific version of Lucene. See also org.apache.lucene.util.Version contained in the
_lucene-core.jar_. Depending on the specific version of Lucene you're using you might have different
options available. When this option is not specified, Hibernate Search will instruct Lucene to use
the default version, which is usually the best option for new projects. Still it's recommended to
define the version you're using explicitly in the configuration so that when you happen to upgrade
Lucene the analyzers will not change behavior. You can then choose to update this value at a later
time, when you for example have the chance to rebuild the index from scratch.

.Force Analyzers to be compatible with a Lucene 3.0 created index

====
----
hibernate.search.lucene_version = LUCENE_30
----
====

This option is global for the configured SearchFactory and affects all Lucene APIs having such a
parameter, as this should be applied consistently. So if you are also making use of Lucene bypassing
Hibernate Search, make sure to apply the same value too.

=== Metadata API

After looking at all these different configuration options, it is time to have a look at an API
which allows you to prorgammatically access parts of the configuration. Via the metadata API you can
determine the indexed types and also how they are mapped (see <<search-mapping>>) to the index
structure. The entry point into this API is the SearchFactory. It offers two methods, namely
+getIndexedTypes()+ and +getIndexedTypeDescriptor(Class<?>)+. The former returns a set of all
indexed type, where as the latter allows to retrieve a so called IndexedTypeDescriptorfor a given
type. This descriptor allows you determine whether the type is indexed at all and, if so, whether
the index is for example sharded or not (see <<advanced-features-sharding>>). It also allows you to
determine the static boost of the type (see <<section-boost-annotation>>) as well as its dynamic
boost strategy (see <<section-dynamic-boost>>). Most importantly, however, you get information about
the indexed properties and generated Lucene Document fields. This is exposed via PropertyDescriptors
respectively FieldDescriptors. The easiest way to get to know the API is to explore it via the IDE
or its javadocs.

[NOTE]
====
All descriptor instances of the metadata API are read only. They do not allow to change any runtime
configuration.
====


[[search-configuration-deploy-on-wildfly]]
=== Hibernate Search as a WildFly module

Hibernate Search is included in the WildFly 8 application server, but you need to activate the module
for your deployment to be able to take advantage of it.

You can either activate the modules already included in your WildFly distribution, or download and
unzip a different version provided by Hibernate Search. The modules system in WildFly
allows to safely run multiple versions of Hibernate ORM and Hibernate Search in parallel.
You can pick the one you need for each deployment.

==== Use the Hibernate Search version included in WildFly

To activate the Hibernate Search modules in wildfly, you have to declare the dependency by
either adding a line in the +MANIFEST.MF+ of your deployment archive, or by including a
resource named +jboss-deployment-structure.xml+.
This resource should be placed in the top level deployment, in META-INF (or WEB-INF for web deployments).


Using the manifest:: Add the following entry to the +MANIFEST.MF+ in your archive:

====
[source]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
Dependencies: org.hibernate.search.orm services
====


Using jboss-deployment-structure.xml:: add a resource named +jboss-deployment-structure.xml+ in your top
level deployment, in META-INF (or WEB-INF for web deployments).

====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <dependencies>
            <module name="org.hibernate.search.orm" services="export" />
        </dependencies>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
====

==== Update and activate latest Hibernate Search version in WildFly

You can also download the latest Hibernate Search provided module and install it. This is often the
best approach as you will benefit from all the latest improvements of
Hibernate Search. Because of the modular design in WildFly, these additional modules can
coexist with the embedded modules and won't affect any other application, unless you
explicitly reconfigure it to use the newer module.

You can download the latest pre-packaged Hibernate Search modules from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-search/{hibernateSearchVersion}/hibernate-search-modules-{hibernateSearchVersion}-wildfly-8-dist.zip/download[Sourceforge].
As a convenience these zip files are also distributed as Maven artifacts:
link:$$https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav~org.hibernate~hibernate-search-modules~~~$$[org.hibernate:hibernate-search-modules-{hibernateSearchVersion}-wildfly-8-dist:zip].

Unpack the modules in your WildFly +modules+ directory: this will create modules for Hibernate Search and Apache Lucene.
The Hibernate Search modules are:

* _org.hibernate.search.orm_, for users of Hibernate Search with Hibernate; this will transitively include Hibernate ORM.
* _org.hibernate.search.engine_, for projects depending on the internal indexing engine that don't require other dependencies to Hibernate.
* _org.hibernate.search.backend-jms_, in case you want to use the JMS backend described in <<search-architecture-jms, JMS Architecture>>.


Using the manifest:: Add the following entry to the +MANIFEST.MF+ in your archive:

====
[source]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
Dependencies: org.hibernate.search.orm:{hibernateSearchVersion} services
====


Using jboss-deployment-structure.xml:: add a resource named +jboss-deployment-structure.xml+ in your top
level deployment, in META-INF (or WEB-INF for web deployments).

====
[source, XML]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
<jboss-deployment-structure>
    <deployment>
        <dependencies>
            <module name="org.hibernate.search.orm" slot="{hibernateSearchVersion}" services="export" />
        </dependencies>
    </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
====

[TIP]
====
Modular classloading is a feature of JBoss EAP 6 as well, but if you are using JBoss EAP, you're
reading the wrong version of the user guide! JBoss EAP subscriptions include official support for
Hibernate Search (as part of the WFK) and come with a different edition of this guide specifically
tailored for EAP users.
