  <para>Last but not least, a few pointers to further information. We highly
  recommend you to get a copy <ulink
  url="http://www.manning.com/bernard/">Hibernate Search in Action</ulink>.
  This excellent book covers Hibernate Search in much more depth than this
  online documentation can and has a great range of additional examples. If
  you want to increase your knowledge of Lucene we recommend <ulink
  url="http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/">Lucene in Action (Second
  Edition)</ulink>. Because Hibernate Search's functionality is tightly
  coupled to Hibernate Core it is a good idea to understand Hibernate.
  Start with the <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org/docs">online
  documentation</ulink> or get hold of a copy of <ulink
  url="http://www.manning.com/bauer2/">Java Persistence with
  Hibernate</ulink>.</para>

  <para>If you have any further questions regarding Hibernate Search or want
  to share some of your use cases have a look at the <ulink
  url="https://community.jboss.org/en/hibernate/search">Hibernate Search
  Wiki</ulink> and the <ulink
  url="https://forum.hibernate.org/viewforum.php?f=9">Hibernate Search
  Forum</ulink>. We are looking forward hearing from you.</para>

  <para>In case you would like to report a bug use the <ulink
  url="https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH">Hibernate
  Search JIRA</ulink> instance. Feedback is always welcome!</para>
