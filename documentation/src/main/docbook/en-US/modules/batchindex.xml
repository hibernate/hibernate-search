  <title>Manual index changes</title>

  <para>As Hibernate core applies changes to the Database, Hibernate Search
  detects these changes and will update the index automatically (unless the
  EventListeners are disabled). Sometimes changes are made to the database
  without using Hibernate, as when backup is restored or your data is
  otherwise affected; for these cases Hibernate Search exposes the Manual
  Index APIs to explicitly update or remove a single entity from the index, or
  rebuild the index for the whole database, or remove all references to a
  specific type.</para>

  <para>All these methods affect the Lucene Index only, no changes are applied
  to the Database.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Adding instances to the index</title>

    <para>Using <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>index(T
    entity)</methodname> you can directly add or update a specific object
    instance to the index. If this entity was already indexed, then the index
    will be updated. Changes to the index are only applied at transaction
    commit.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Indexing an entity via <methodname>FullTextSession.index(T
      entity)</methodname></title>

      <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">FullTextSession fullTextSession = Search.getFullTextSession(session);
Transaction tx = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
Object customer = fullTextSession.load( Customer.class, 8 );
<emphasis role="bold">fullTextSession.index(customer);</emphasis>
tx.commit(); //index only updated at commit time</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>In case you want to add all instances for a type, or for all indexed
    types, the recommended approach is to use a
    <classname>MassIndexer</classname>: see <xref
    linkend="search-batchindex-massindexer"/> for more details.</para>

    <para>The method <methodname>FullTextSession.index(T
    entity)</methodname> is considered an explicit indexing operation, so any
    registered <classname>EntityIndexingInterceptor</classname> won't be applied
    in this case. For more information on <classname>EntityIndexingInterceptor</classname>
    see <xref linkend="search-mapping-indexinginterceptor"/>.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Deleting instances from the index</title>

    <para>It is equally possible to remove an entity or all entities of a
    given type from a Lucene index without the need to physically remove them
    from the database. This operation is named purging and is also done
    through the <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Purging a specific instance of an entity from the index</title>

      <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">FullTextSession fullTextSession = Search.getFullTextSession(session);
Transaction tx = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
for (Customer customer : customers) {
    <emphasis role="bold">fullTextSession.purge( Customer.class, customer.getId() );</emphasis>
}
tx.commit(); //index is updated at commit time</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Purging will remove the entity with the given id from the Lucene
    index but will not touch the database.</para>

    <para>If you need to remove all entities of a given type, you can use the
    <methodname>purgeAll</methodname> method. This operation removes all
    entities of the type passed as a parameter as well as all its
    subtypes.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Purging all instances of an entity from the index</title>

      <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">FullTextSession fullTextSession = Search.getFullTextSession(session);
Transaction tx = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
<emphasis role="bold">fullTextSession.purgeAll( Customer.class );</emphasis>
//optionally optimize the index
//fullTextSession.getSearchFactory().optimize( Customer.class );
tx.commit(); //index changes are applied at commit time    </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>As in the previous example, it is suggested to optimize the index
    after many purge operation to actually free the used space.</para>

    <para>As is the case with method <methodname>FullTextSession.index(T
    entity)</methodname>, also <methodname>purge</methodname> and
    <methodname>purgeAll</methodname> are considered explicit indexinging
    operations: any registered <classname>EntityIndexingInterceptor</classname>
    won't be applied. For more information on <classname>EntityIndexingInterceptor</classname>
    see <xref linkend="search-mapping-indexinginterceptor"/>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Methods <methodname>index</methodname>,
      <methodname>purge</methodname> and <methodname>purgeAll</methodname> are
      available on <classname>FullTextEntityManager</classname> as
      well.</para>
    </note>

    <note>
      <para>All manual indexing methods (<methodname>index</methodname>,
      <methodname>purge</methodname> and <methodname>purgeAll</methodname>)
      only affect the index, not the database, nevertheless they are
      transactional and as such they won't be applied until the transaction is
      successfully committed, or you make use of
      <methodname>flushToIndexes</methodname>.</para>
    </note>
  </section>

  <section id="search-batchindex">
    <title>Rebuilding the whole index</title>

    <para>If you change the entity mapping to the index, chances are that the
    whole Index needs to be updated; For example if you decide to index a an
    existing field using a different analyzer you'll need to rebuild the index
    for affected types. Also if the Database is replaced (like restored from a
    backup, imported from a legacy system) you'll want to be able to rebuild
    the index from existing data. Hibernate Search provides two main
    strategies to choose from:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Using
        <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>flushToIndexes()</methodname>
        periodically, while using
        <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>index()</methodname>
        on all entities.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Use a <classname>MassIndexer</classname>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="search-batchindex-flushtoindexes">
      <title>Using flushToIndexes()</title>

      <para>This strategy consists in removing the existing index and then
      adding all entities back to the index using
      <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>purgeAll()</methodname>
      and
      <classname>FullTextSession</classname>.<methodname>index()</methodname>,
      however there are some memory and efficiency contraints. For maximum
      efficiency Hibernate Search batches index operations and executes them
      at commit time. If you expect to index a lot of data you need to be
      careful about memory consumption since all documents are kept in a queue
      until the transaction commit. You can potentially face an
      <classname>OutOfMemoryException</classname> if you don't empty the queue
      periodically: to do this you can use
      <methodname>fullTextSession.flushToIndexes()</methodname>. Every time
      <methodname>fullTextSession.flushToIndexes()</methodname> is called (or
      if the transaction is committed), the batch queue is processed applying
      all index changes. Be aware that, once flushed, the changes cannot be
      rolled back.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Index rebuilding using index() and flushToIndexes()</title>

        <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">fullTextSession.setFlushMode(FlushMode.MANUAL);
fullTextSession.setCacheMode(CacheMode.IGNORE);
transaction = fullTextSession.beginTransaction();
//Scrollable results will avoid loading too many objects in memory
ScrollableResults results = fullTextSession.createCriteria( Email.class )
    .setFetchSize(BATCH_SIZE)
    .scroll( ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY );
int index = 0;
while( results.next() ) {
    index++;
    fullTextSession.index( results.get(0) ); //index each element
    if (index % BATCH_SIZE == 0) {
        fullTextSession.flushToIndexes(); //apply changes to indexes
        fullTextSession.clear(); //free memory since the queue is processed
    }
}
transaction.commit();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Try to use a batch size that guarantees that your application will
      not run out of memory: with a bigger batch size objects are fetched
      faster from database but more memory is needed.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="search-batchindex-massindexer">
      <title>Using a MassIndexer</title>

      <para>Hibernate Search's <classname>MassIndexer</classname> uses several
      parallel threads to rebuild the index; you can optionally select which
      entities need to be reloaded or have it reindex all entities. This
      approach is optimized for best performance but requires to set the
      application in maintenance mode: making queries to the index is not
      recommended when a MassIndexer is busy.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Index rebuilding using a MassIndexer</title>

        <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">fullTextSession.createIndexer().startAndWait();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>This will rebuild the index, deleting it and then reloading all
      entities from the database. Although it's simple to use, some tweaking
      is recommended to speed up the process: there are several parameters
      configurable.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>During the progress of a MassIndexer the content of the index is
        undefined! If a query is performed while the MassIndexer is working
        most likely some results will be missing.</para>
      </warning>

      <example>
        <title>Using a tuned MassIndexer</title>

        <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">fullTextSession
 .createIndexer( User.class )
 .batchSizeToLoadObjects( 25 )
 .cacheMode( CacheMode.NORMAL )
 .threadsToLoadObjects( 12 )
 .idFetchSize( 150 )
 .progressMonitor( monitor ) //a MassIndexerProgressMonitor implementation
 .startAndWait();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>This will rebuild the index of all User instances (and subtypes),
      and will create 12 parallel threads to load the User instances using
      batches of 25 objects per query; these same 12 threads will also need
      to process indexed embedded relations and custom <classname>FieldBridge</classname>s
      or <classname>ClassBridge</classname>s, to finally output a Lucene
      document. In this conversion process these threads are likely going to
      need to trigger lazyloading of additional attributes, so you will
      probably need a high number of threads working in parallel.
      The number of threads working on actual index writing is defined by the backend
      configuration of each index. See the option
      <literal>worker.thread_pool.size</literal> in <xref
      linkend="table-work-execution-configuration"/>.</para>

      <para>As of Hibernate Search 4.4.0, instead of indexing all the types
      in parallel, the MassIndexer is configured by default to index only
      one type in parallel. It prevents resource exhaustion especially
      database connections and usually does not slow down the indexing.
      You can however configure this behavior using
      <classname>MassIndexer</classname>.<methodname>typesToIndexInParallel(int threadsToIndexObjects)</methodname>:
      </para>

      <example>
        <title>Configuring the MassIndexer to index several types in parallel</title>

        <programlisting language="JAVA" role="JAVA">fullTextSession
 .createIndexer( User.class, Customer.class )
 .typesToIndexInParallel( 2 )
 .batchSizeToLoadObjects( 25 )
 .cacheMode( CacheMode.NORMAL )
 .threadsToLoadObjects( 5 )
 .idFetchSize( 150 )
 .progressMonitor( monitor ) //a MassIndexerProgressMonitor implementation
 .startAndWait();</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>Generally we suggest to leave cacheMode to
      <literal>CacheMode.IGNORE</literal> (the default), as in most reindexing
      situations the cache will be a useless additional overhead; it might be
      useful to enable some other <literal>CacheMode</literal> depending on
      your data: it could increase performance if the main entity is relating
      to enum-like data included in the index.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The MassIndexer was designed for speed and is unaware of
        transactions, so there is no need to begin one or committing. Also
        because it is not transactional it is not recommended to let users use
        the system during its processing, as it is unlikely people will be
        able to find results and the system load might be too high
        anyway.</para>
      </note>

      <section id="search-batchindexing-threadsandconnections">
      <title>MassIndexer using threads and JDBC connections</title>
      <para>The MassIndexer was designed to finish the reindexing task as
      quickly as possible, but this requires a bit of care in its configuration
      to behave fairly with your server resources.</para>
      <para>There is a simple formula to understand how the different options
      applied to the MassIndexer affect the number of used worker threads
      and connections: each thread will require a JDBC connection.</para>
      <para><programlisting>threads = typesToIndexInParallel * (threadsToLoadObjects + 1);
required JDBC connections = threads;</programlisting></para>
      <para>Let's see some suggestions for a roughly sane tuning starting point:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Option <literal>typesToIndexInParallel</literal> should probably be a low value, like 1 or 2, depending on how
          much of your CPUs have spare cycles and how slow a database round trip will be.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Before tuning a parallel run, experiment with options to tune your primary indexed entities in isolation.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Making <literal>threadsToLoadObjects</literal> higher increases the preloading rate for the picked entities
          from the database, but also increases memory usage and the pressure on the threads working on subsequent indexing.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Increasing parallelism usually helps as the bottleneck usually is the latency to the database connection: it's
          probably worth it to experiment with values significantly higher than the number of actual cores available,
          but make sure your database can handle all the multiple requests.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>This advice might not apply to you: always measure the effects! We're providing this as a means to help you
          understand how these options are related.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <warning>
        <para>Running the MassIndexer with many threads will require many
        connections to the database. If you don't have a sufficiently large
        connection pool, the MassIndexer itself and/or your other
        applications could starve being unable to serve
        other requests: make sure you size your connection pool accordingly
        to the options as explained in the above paragraph.</para>
      </warning>
      <tip>
        <para>The "sweet spot" of number of threads to achieve best
        performance is highly dependent on your overall architecture, database
        design and even data values. All internal thread groups have meaningful
        names so they should be easily identified with most diagnostic tools,
        including simply threaddumps.</para>
