msgid "Last but not least, a few pointers to further information. He highly recommend you to get a copy <ulink url=\"http://www.manning.com/bernard/\">Hibernate Search in Action</ulink>. This excellent book covers Hibernate Search in much more depth than this online documentation can and has a great range of additional examples. If you want to increase your knowledge in Lucene we recommend <ulink url=\"http://www.manning.com/hatcher3/\">Lucene in Action (Second Edition)</ulink>. Because Hibernate Search's functionality is tightly coupled to Hibernate Core is it a good idea to understand Hibernate in more detail. Start with the <ulink url=\"http://www.hibernate.org/docs\">online documentation</ulink> or get hold of a copy of <ulink url=\"http://www.manning.com/bauer2/\">Java Persistence with Hibernate</ulink>."
