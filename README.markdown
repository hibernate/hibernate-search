# Hibernate Search
Version: 4.1.0.Beta1 released on 3 February 2012


## Description

Full text search engines like Apache Lucene(tm) are a very powerful technology to
bring free text/efficient queries to applications. It suffers several mismatches
when dealing with a object domain model (keeping the index up to date, mismatch
between the index structure and the domain model, ...).  
Hibernate Search indexes your domain model thanks to a few annotations, takes
care of the index synchronization, brings you back managed objects from free text
queries.  
Hibernate Search is using [Apache Lucene(tm)](http://lucene.apache.org/) under the cover.

This version of Hibernate Search requires:

 - Hibernate Core 4.0 and above
 - Apache Lucene 3.5
