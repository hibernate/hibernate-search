    * [HSEARCH-59] - Unable to index @indexEmbedded object through session.index when object is lazy and field access is used in object


** Improvement
    * [HSEARCH-36] - Meaningful exception message when Search Listeners are not initialized
    * [HSEARCH-38] - Make the @IndexedEmbedded documentation example easier to understand
    * [HSEARCH-51] - Optimization: Use a query rather than batch-size to load objects when a single entity (hierarchy) is expected
    * [HSEARCH-63] - rename query.resultSize() to getResultSize()

** New Feature
    * [HSEARCH-4] - Be able to use a Lucene Sort on queries (Hardy Ferentschik)
    * [HSEARCH-13] - Cache IndexReaders per SearchFactory
    * [HSEARCH-40] - Be able to embed collections in lucene index (@IndexedEmbeddable in collections)
    * [HSEARCH-43] - Expose resultSize and do not load object when only resultSize is retrieved
    * [HSEARCH-52] - Ability to load more efficiently an object graph from a lucene query by customizing the fetch modes
    * [HSEARCH-53] - Add support for projection (ie read the data from the index only)
    * [HSEARCH-61] - Move from MultiSearcher to MultiReader
    * [HSEARCH-62] - Support pluggable ReaderProvider strategies

** Task
    * [HSEARCH-65] - Update to JBoss Embedded beta2
