 * A processor for batched works that triggers work execution

 * <p>
 * Works are added by submitting as many works as necessary through {@link #submit(BulkableWork)}.
 * Execution starts as soon as possible,
 * which may be as late as when {@link #endBatch()} is called.
 * <p>
 * Two works submitted to this orchestrator in the same batch will always be executed
 * one after the other, never in parallel.
