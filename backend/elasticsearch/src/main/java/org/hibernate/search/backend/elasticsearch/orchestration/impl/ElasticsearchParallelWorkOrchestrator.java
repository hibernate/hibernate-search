 * Parallel orchestrators are suitable when the client takes the responsibility
 * of submitting works as needed to implement ordering: if work #2 must be executed after work #1,
 * the client will take care of waiting until #1 is done before he submits #2.
 * <p>
 * With a parallel orchestrator:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Works are executed in unpredictable order, irrespective of the order they were submitted in.
 *     <li>Two submitted works may be sent together in a single bulk request.
 *     <li>The application will <strong>not</strong> wait for already-submitted works to finish when shutting down.
