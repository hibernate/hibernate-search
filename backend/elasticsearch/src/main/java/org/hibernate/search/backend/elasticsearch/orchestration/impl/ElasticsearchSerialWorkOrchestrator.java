/**
 * A thread-safe component ordering and planning the execution of works
 * serially, in the order they were submitted.
 * <p>
 * Serial orchestrators are best used as index-scoped orchestrators,
 * when many works are submitted from different threads:
 * they allow easy implementation of a reasonably safe (though imperfect) concurrency control by expecting
 * the most recent work to hold the most recent data to be indexed.
 * <p>
 * With a serial orchestrator:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Works are executed in the order they were submitted in.
 *     <li>Two submitted works from the may be sent together in a single bulk request,
 *     but only if all the works between them are bulked too.
 *     <li>The application will wait for already-submitted works to finish when shutting down.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that while serial orchestrators preserve ordering as best they can,
 * they lead to a lesser throughput and can only guarantee ordering within a single JVM.
 * When multiple JVMs with multiple instances of Hibernate Search target the same index,
 * the relative order of indexing works might end up being different
 * from the relative order of the database changes that triggered indexing,
 * eventually leading to out-of-sync indexes.
