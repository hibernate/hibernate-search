/**
 * The Workspace implementation to be used to take advantage of NRT Lucene features.
 * IndexReader instances are obtained directly from the IndexWriter, which is not forced
 * to flush all pending changes to the Directory structure.
 * 
 * We keep a reference Reader, obtained from the IndexWriter each time a transactional queue
 * is applied, so that the IndexReader instance "sees" only fully committed transactions;
 * the reference is never returned to clients, but each time a client needs an IndexReader
 * a clone is created from the last refreshed IndexReader.
 * 
 * Since the backend is forced to create a reference IndexReader after each (skipped) commit,
 * some IndexReaders might be opened without being ever used.
 * 
 * This class implements both Workspace and ReaderProvider.
