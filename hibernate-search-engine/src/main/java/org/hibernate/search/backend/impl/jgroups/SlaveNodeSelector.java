/**
 * <p>This {@link org.hibernate.search.backend.impl.jgroups.NodeSelectorStrategy} is a static configuration for the local
 * node to avoid processing any indexing operations locally.
 * It is assumed that some other node in the cluster will process it; which
 * node exactly is unknown, so messages are broadcasted to the group.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is no guarantee of processing: if no master picks up the task,
 * the index update operation is skipped. This can be mitigated by making
 * sure at least one master is always online; if a persistent queue is
 * needed it's better to use the JMS backend.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation matches the {@literal jgroupsSlave} configuration property.</p>
