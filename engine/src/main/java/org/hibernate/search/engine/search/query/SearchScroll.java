 * An ongoing query execution delivering hits continuously from a single snapshot of the index.

 * This is different from classic pagination, where a loop executes the same query multiple times with an incrementing offset.
 * Classic pagination will execute the query against a different snapshot of the index for each call to {@code fetch(...)},
 * potentially leading to some hits appearing in two subsequent pages if the index was modified between two executions.
 * Scrolls do not suffer from this limitation and guarantee that each hit is returned only once.
 * <p>
 * As the scroll maintains a reference to internal resources that ultimately must be freed,
 * the client must call {@link #close()} when it no longer needs the scroll.
 * Additionally, some implementations have an internal timeout beyond which the scroll will automatically close
 * and will no longer be usable.
 *
 * @param <H> The type of hits.
