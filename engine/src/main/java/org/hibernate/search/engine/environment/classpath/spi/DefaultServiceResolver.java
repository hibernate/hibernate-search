	 * A {@link ServiceResolver} that will detect services defined in the class path or in the module path.
	 * <p>
	 * This implementation only works when running Hibernate Search on Java 9 and above.
	 * On Java 8, {@link ClassPathOnlyServiceResolver} must be used.
	 * <p>
	 * When retrieving services from providers in the module path,
	 * the service loader internally uses a map from classloader to service catalog.
	 * Since the aggregated class loader is artificial and unknown from the service loader,
	 * it will never match any service from the module path.
	 * <p>
	 * To work around this problem,
	 * we try to get services from a service loader bound to the aggregated class loader first,
	 * then we try a service loader bound to each individual class loader.
	 * <p>
	 * This could result in duplicates, so we take specific care to avoid using the same service provider twice.
	 * See {@link #loadJavaServices(Class)}.
	 * <p>
	 * Note that, in the worst case,
	 * the service retrieved from each individual class loader could load duplicate versions
	 * of classes already loaded from another class loader.
	 * For example in an aggregated class loader made up of individual class loader A, B, C:
	 * it is possible that class C1 was already loaded from A,
	 * but then we load service S1 from B, and this service will also need class C1 but won't find it in class loader B,
	 * so it will load its own version of that class.
	 * <p>
	 * We assume that this situation will never occur in practice because class loaders
	 * are structure in a hierarchy that prevents one class to be loaded twice.
