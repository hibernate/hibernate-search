/**
 * An object where the clauses and options of a {@link SearchPredicateFactory#bool() boolean predicate} can be set.
 * <p>
 * Different types of clauses have different effects, see below.
 *
 * <h2 id="must">"must" clauses</h2>
 * <p>
 * "must" clauses are required to match: if they don't match, then the boolean predicate will not match.
 * <p>
 * Matching "must" clauses are taken into account during score computation.
 *
 * <h2 id="mustnot">"must not" clauses</h2>
 * <p>
 * "must not" clauses are required to not match: if they match, then the boolean predicate will not match.
 * <p>
 * "must not" clauses are ignored during score computation.
 *
 * <h2 id="filter">"filter" clauses</h2>
 * <p>
 * "filter" clauses are required to match: if they don't match, then the boolean predicate will not match.
 * <p>
 * "filter" clauses are ignored during score computation,
 * and so are any clauses of boolean predicates contained in the filter clause (even "must" or "should" clauses).
 *
 * <h2 id="should">"should" clauses</h2>
 * <p>
 * "should" clauses may optionally match, and are required to match depending on the context.
 * <p>
 * Matching "should" clauses are taken into account during score computation.
 * <p>
 * The exact behavior of `should` clauses is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *     When there isn't any "must" clause nor any "filter" clause in the boolean predicate,
 *     then at least one "should" clause is required to match.
 *     Simply put, in this case, the "should" clauses
 *     <strong>behave as if there was an "OR" operator between each of them</strong>.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     When there is at least one "must" clause or one "filter" clause in the boolean predicate,
 *     then the "should" clauses are not required to match,
 *     and are simply used for scoring.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     This behavior can be changed by specifying
 *     <a href="MinimumShouldMatchConditionStep.html#minimumshouldmatch">"minimumShouldMatch" constraints</a>.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <S> The "self" type (the actual exposed type of this collector).
