	 * <p>
	 * A single mapping element may lead to multiple "uses":
	 * for example an indexed-embedded may be inherited by sub-types of the type defining the indexed-embedded (the "hosting type"),
	 * or an indexed-embedded may recurse (directly or indirectly) into the the type defining the indexed-embedded.
	 * In such case, each "use" of the indexed-embedded may occur in a different context
	 * and thus use different parts of the definition,
	 * so we need a single, shared path tracker across all occurrences
	 * to gives us a complete view of encountered paths and to allow us to decide
	 * whether an includePaths/excludePaths is useful or not.
	 *
	 * @param mappingElement A unique representation of the mapping element involving a tree filter;
	 * if the same mapping element is applied in multiple places,
	 * this method must be called with mapping elements that are equal according to {@link MappingElement#equals(Object)}/{@link MappingElement#hashCode()}.
	 * @param filterDefinition The filter definition passed to the {@link TreeFilterPathTracker} upon creation.
	 * @return The path tracker for that definition.
