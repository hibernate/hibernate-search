/**
 * A schema filter, responsible for deciding which parts of a mapping will actually make it to the index schema.
 * <p>
 * A schema filter is created at the root of a Pojo mapping (it accepts everything),
 * and also each time index embedding ({@code @IndexedEmbedded}) is used.
 *
 * <h3 id="filter-usage">Filter usage</h3>
 * <p>
 * A schema filter is asked to provide advice about whether or not to trim down the schema in two cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When a field is added by a bridge, the filter decides whether to include this field or not
 *     through its {@link #isPathIncluded(String)} method</li>
 *     <li>When a nested {@code @IndexedEmbedded} is requested, a new filter is created through the
 *     {@link #compose(IndexedEmbeddedDefinition, IndexedEmbeddedPathTracker)} method, which may return a filter
 *     that {@link #isEveryPathExcluded() excludes every path}, meaning the {@code @IndexedEmbedded} will
 *     be ignored</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3 id="filter-properties">Filter properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * A filter decides whether to include a path or not according to its two main properties:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the {@link #depthFilter depth filter}</li>
 *     <li>the {@link #pathFilter path filter}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The path filter, as its name suggests, define which paths
 * should be accepted by this filter.
 * <p>
 * The depth filter defines
 * how paths that are not included by the path filter should be treated:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>as long as the remaining depth is unlimited (null) or strictly positive, paths are included by default</li>
 *     <li>as soon as the remaining depth is zero or negative, paths are excluded by default</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3 id="filter-composition">Filter composition</h3>
 * <p>
 * Composed filters are created whenever a nested {@code @IndexedEmbedded} is encountered.
 * A composed filter will always enforce the restrictions of its parent filter,
 * plus some added restrictions depending on the properties of the nested {@code IndexedEmbedded}.
 * <p>
 * For more information about how filters are composed, see
 * {@link #compose(IndexedEmbeddedDefinition, IndexedEmbeddedPathTracker)}.
