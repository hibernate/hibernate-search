 * Lazily loaded Services might need a BuilContext to retrieve additional services;
 * in such a case we can wrap a reference to a {@link ServiceManager} and a
 * {@link SearchFactoryImplementor} to create a limited BuildContext:
 * we're out of the boot phase at this point so not all operations are legal.
 *
 * This isn't great design but we need it to temporarily keep backwards compatibility,
 * so this class was deprecated since it's first version.
