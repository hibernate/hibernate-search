/**
 * A tree filter, responsible for deciding which parts of a (potentially cyclic) graph will be retained as a tree,
 * e.g. in an index schema.
 * <p>
 * A tree filter that accepts everything is created at the root of tree-like mapping structures (e.g. a Pojo mapping).
 * Then, each time specific nesting features (e.g. index embedding with {@code @IndexedEmbedded}) are used,
 * another filter is created with the constraints defined through that feature
 * (e.g. {@code @IndexedEmbedded(includePaths = ...)}).
 * <p>
 * <h3 id="filter-usage">Filter usage in index schemas</h3>
 * <p>
 * A tree filter is asked to provide advice about whether to trim down the index schema in two cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When a field is added by a bridge, the filter decides whether to include this field or not
 *     through its {@link #isPathIncluded(String)} method</li>
 *     <li>When a nested filter (e.g. {@code @IndexedEmbedded}) is requested, a new filter is created through the
 *     {@link #compose(MappingElement, String, TreeFilterDefinition, TreeFilterPathTracker, BiFunction)}  method,
 *     which may return an empty optional,
 *     meaning that the nested filter {@link #isEveryPathExcluded() excludes every path}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3 id="filter-properties">Filter properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * A tree filter decides whether to include a path or not according to its two main properties:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the {@link #depthFilter depth filter}</li>
 *     <li>the {@link #pathFilter path filter}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The path filter, as its name suggests, define which paths
 * should be explicitly included or excluded by this filter.
 * <p>
 * The depth filter defines
 * how paths that are not explicitly included or excluded by the path filter should be treated:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>as long as the remaining depth is unlimited (null) or strictly positive, paths are included by default</li>
 *     <li>as soon as the remaining depth is zero or negative, paths are excluded by default</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3 id="filter-composition">Filter composition</h3>
 * <p>
 * Composed filters are created whenever a nested filter (e.g. {@code @IndexedEmbedded}) is encountered.
 * A composed filter will always enforce the restrictions of its parent filter,
 * plus some added restrictions depending on the properties of the nested filter.
 * <p>
 * For more information about how filters are composed, see
 * {@link #compose(MappingElement, String, TreeFilterDefinition, TreeFilterPathTracker, BiFunction)}.
