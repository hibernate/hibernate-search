/**

 * <h2 id="field-paths">Field paths</h2>
 *
 * By default, field paths passed to this DSL are interpreted as absolute,
 * i.e. relative to the index root.
 * <p>
 * However, a new, "relative" factory can be created with {@link #withRoot(String)}:
 * the new factory interprets paths as relative to the object field passed as argument to the method.
 * <p>
 * This can be useful when calling reusable methods that can apply the same aggregation
 * on different object fields that have same structure (same sub-fields).
 * <p>
 * Such a factory can also transform relative paths into absolute paths using {@link #toAbsolutePath(String)};
 * this can be useful for native aggregations in particular.
