/**
 * Serialization provider
 *
 * Providers are encouraged to offer a backward and forward compatible protocol.
 *
 * //FIXME should these two bytes be processed by Hibernate Search and not the protocol implementation
 * ie we would pass the result of this?
 *
 * Before the actual serialized flux, two bytes are reserved:
 * - majorVersion
 * - minorVersion
 *
 * A major version increase implies an incompatible protocol change.
 * Messages of a majorVersion > current version should be refused.
 *
 * A minor version increase implies a compatible protocol change.
 * Messages of a minorVersion > current version are parsed but new
 * operation will be ignored or rejected. Question: only ignored?
 *
 * If message's major version is < current version, the
 * implementation is strongly encouraged to parse and process them.
 * It is mandatory if only message's minor version is < current version.
 * 
 * Implementors are encouraged to implement a descriptive <code>toString()</code>
 * method for logging purposes.
