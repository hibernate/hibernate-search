/**
 * Represent a Serializable Lucene unit work
 *
 * WARNING: This class aims to be serializable and passed in an asynchronous way across VMs
 *          any non backward compatible serialization change should be done with great care
 *          and publically announced. Specifically, new versions of Hibernate Search should be
 *          able to handle changes produced by older versions of Hibernate Search if reasonably possible.
 *          That is why each subclass susceptible to be pass along have a magic serialization number.
 *          NOTE: we are relying on Lucene's Document to play nice unfortunately
